    <text>For this reason, the helicase activity and the C-terminal domain of BLM are important factors for maintaining genomic stability as measured by the sister chromatid exchange assay, and it seems that the amount of C–terminally abundant (GLD) localization of these molecules into the nucleolus by mutually agreed upon Cterminality appears to be more important for genomic instability than localized localisation in the nuclear bodies.</text>

    <text>Term-enhanced Hepadnaviruses are small, enveloped hepatotropic viruses that replicate by reverse transcription of a pregenomic RNA molecule. P binds to the 5' copy of  and commences DNA synthesis, using a tyrosine residue near its own amino-terminus as supplementary information. DNA synthesis occurs after 3–4 nucleotides, and then the protein-linked minus-strand DNA is transferred to this copy (the doppelganger) within the 3' terminal duplication. The minus-strand DNA is prepared as a primer by the pregenomic RNA, and its ribonucleaseH activity degrades it during synthesis. In spite of this, the RNAseH activity fails to digest the extreme 5' end of the template ARN, and the fragment is then transferred to direct repeat 2 (DR2), where it serves as a primer for synthesising plus-strand DNA. Unlike the reverse transcriptases of retroviruses that are better understood, the hepadnaviral P protein differs in several ways: it starts DNA synthesis with its amino-terminal domain, cannot be obtained from virions without partial proteolysis or denaturation, and is only active on the endogenous pregenomic RNA that is encapsulated in the viral cores. It is not known how this cleaved out but appears due to the covalent linkage between P and the viral DNA, which is likely to explain why: RNAseH inserts the end of the ribonuclear layer in a RNA:DNA heteroduplex, but it does no damage any DNA or non-hybrid material (in that case the protein P doesn’t cut the part of its own end after it had already been reverse transcriptionally copied into DNA). The absence of RNAseH activity hinders the production of infectious virions or positive polarity DNA. Although not yet measured directly in viral core particles, its presence is suggested by four observations, (i) Sequence alignment of P with known RNsES enzymes shows conservation motifs in P. By modifying their active site residues, the expected RNA:DNA heteroduplex is prevented from being synthesized by blocking mutations in both Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and duck hepatitic B virus (DHBV) P. The detection of ARNseH activity for the human HEpaticisB virus was confirmed through the expression of an ion called fusion with the maltoses binding protein. Purified DHBV cores were used to generate activity gels, but the apparent molecular weight of RNAseH was lower than that of the native PH, suggesting that P was either cleaved or signaled by a cellular ARNseleH. We attempted to directly detect the RNAseH activity of DHBV P within viral cores using substrates from out of the virus. However, no specific results were obtained despite extensive experiments with different conditions and substrate combinations. Given that P has intrinsic RNAseH activity, we hypothesize that the hepadnaviral ARNsеH activation will be &quot;substrate committed&quot; in a similar way to the template commitment observed for its DNA polymerase activity.</text>

    <text>Here, we report for the first time that nuclear sequestration of a ribosomal protein occurs at the start of stationary phase; this regulation seems to allow for rapid production of their proteins in the presence (if nutrients are encountered) before pronounced stationary phases. Recent studies indicate that the nucleolus-sequestered cdc14 release is essential for the successful exit of mitosis. As ribosomes have the ability to regulate cell cycle progression, sequestering a nihilosomal component in the nuclear nukleus may be an extra regulation necessary for proper cell cycles arrest.</text>
