    <text>The implications are examined, such as the observation that the data contradicts Masters and Johnson's earlier statement that penis size does not have a direct impact on female sexual satisfaction.</text>

    <text>The pediatric intensive care unit uses chest radiographs to evaluate cardiopulmonary abnormalities, assess acute clinical deterioration, and identify the location of invasive life support devices like central venous catheters and endotracheal tubes. It is common to require immediate interpretation of chest radiographs to determine the appropriate position of invasive devices and diagnose or treat conditions. Pediatric intensivists (PI) at the bedside are typically the first physicians to interpret a radiographic image, and their interpretations often inform other clinicians about the necessary diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Radiology interpretation is not readily available in hospitals where less than 30% of radiologists are present 24 hours per day, resulting in an unavailability for a radiologist to interpret chest radiographs until after acute interventions. This makes it essential for the PI to provide accurate readings of these images when he or she is unavailable due to lack of immediate availability. There are only a few centers that have tools to detect discrepancies between the radiologist and the treating physician, and whether these discr√©tionary differences may result in inappropriate changes in therapy. No research has yet examined the accuracy of board-certified PI's interpretation of chest radiographs. The aim of this research was to establish the agreement on chest radiograph interpretation between PI and pediatric radiologists (PR) and to determine if discrepancies caused adverse patient outcomes.</text>

    <text>Measuring fertilization-induced calcium transients provides a novel experimental technique for studying C. elegans. Researchers can now use this technique to detect potential calcium defect in many mutants with known fertilizer defects using forward genetic and gene knockout and RNAi methods. It is recommended that elegans permit the identification of proteins that may be involved in this crucial step of embryonic development.</text>
