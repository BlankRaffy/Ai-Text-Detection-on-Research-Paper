    <text>The interaction between the MS2 coat protein and its translational operator is a well-established example of RNA-protein recognition, utilizing genetic, biochemical, and structural methods. Figure 1 displays the primary and secondary structures of the recombinant rRNA hairpin that establish contacts with both subunits of each coat proteins dimer. The coat protein complex with its RNA target is highly intricate, as two unpaired adenosines are inserted into equivalent pockets on different subunits of the coat dimer (Figure 2). The interactions between A-4 and A-10 with coat proteins involve non-identical contacts with the same five amino acid residues, Val29, Thr45, Ser47, Finally, and Lys61. The use of X-ray crystallographic analysis indicates specific amino acid-nucleotide interactions, but fails to provide a clear explanation of their respective roles in RNA-binding and translational repression. In the experiments described here, we used amino acid substitutions of A-pocket amino acids in single-chain coat protein heterodimers to determine the significance of each residue's interaction with A-4 and A-10.</text>

    <text>Public trust can be boosted by disclosing conflicts of interest, which could help to eliminate doubts about the integrity of clinical guidelines. This is where guideline authors and journal editors should focus their attention, as disclosure may reduce time spent documenting conflict reports.</text>
