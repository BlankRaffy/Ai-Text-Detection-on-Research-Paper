    <text>The role played by tandem repeats in tandem mapping of genetic maps has made them a crucial aspect of mammalian genetics, and they continue to be utilized for forensic DNA fingerprinting. The classification of tandem repeats is usually based on their location among satellites (encompassing megabases of DNA, associated with heterochromatin), minisatellites (repeat units in the range of 6-100 bp, spanning hundreds of base-pairs) and microsales (ranging from 1-5 dp). The discovery of tandem repeats, such as mini and microsatellites, has been supported by several studies that suggest they can be a crucial source of marker information for identifying pathogenic bacteria, even in the absence of newly evolved monomorphic pathogens. The significance of tandem repeats in the adaptation of pathogens to their host is likely reflected in this. Tandem repeat activity in bacteria appears to vary in two ways: within the regulatory region of a gene, they can cause an on/off switch in gene expression at the transcriptional level. The presence of tandem repetition within coding regions with repeat unit lengths not greater than three can result in a reversible premature end of translation caused by mutations that alter the number of repeats. In such cases, changes in the number of copies alter the gene product itself. The mutation mechanisms of micro and minisatellites have been studied in detail in eukaryotes, specifically human and yeast (refer to). The data obtained thus far indicates that microsatellites undergo mutativity via replication slippage processes, with mutation rates being influenced by the effectiveness of mismatch repair mechanisms and internal heterogeneity within the array that helps stabilize the tandem repeat. Minisatellites undergo mutation in response to a double strand break that is initiated within or near the tandem repeat, but these events can occur naturally in eukaryotes. The minisatellite mutation rate in eukaryotes seems to be unresponsive to mismatch repair efficiency, and internal heterogeneity is compatible with a high mutation. In bacteria, simple sequence contingency loci (repeat units of 1-8 bp) have been identified as such. The altered number of repeats permits the corresponding gene to enter and exit reversible on and off states of expression. The mutation rate of a tetranucleotide tract in Haemophilus influenzae is above 10-4, which helps the pathogen adapt to its hosts as the infection progresses. When faced with extreme circumstances, the microsatellite is not very useful for identifying strains, performing epidemiological and phylogenetic studies. The tandem repeat array is made up of perfect copies of the elementary unit, and different alleles are detected in a single culture. On the other hand, DNA sequencing can be used to verify the phylogenetic identity of minisatellite alleles of the same size, as the units are frequently duplicated but not perfect. The pattern of variants along the array provides an extra layer of allle identification and chromosomal information. Moreover, the use of ordinary horizontal gel electrophoresis can easily type tandem repeats with longer repeat unit length within the size range of a few hundred base-pairs. We will initially explore how a tandem repeats database can be used to sequence bacterial genomes and briefly compare the overall features of tandem repetitions in various endemic bacteriological species whose sequence has been determined and made available to the public. The demonstration will demonstrate how this device can be used to quickly characterize new and polymorphic markers in two pathogens, Y. pestis and B. anthracis. Pestis, a high-resolution typing tool, is based on RFLP analysis of IS100 locations. However, this technology is more complex than PCR typing, which is why it has been developed. In the case of B. anthracis in the U.S., polymorphisms were initially identified essentially using AFLP (Applied Functional Functional Protein Polymerase) typing. Subsequent analyses revealed that the most informative fragments in AFLP patterns were generated by variation in tandem repeat array length (five minisatellite loci).</text>

    <text>Annotations for a new genome are likely to be equally good as the database(s) to which they are compared. The COG database was established on the basis of the phylogenetic principle of protein classification, which involves clustering by (probable) orthology. Furthermore, significant efforts have been made to characterize and classify the COGs for functional purposes. This resulted in many benefits for annotating new genomes of organisms outside of well-characterized groups, including obtaining important functional predictions that are not possible with conventional annotation protocols. Moreover, by means of the arrangement of COG database, it is feasible to uncover the primary functional components of an organism and its potential evolutionary similarities, as well as to systematically identify sets of genes whose presence or absence in the given genome is unexpected and instructive from an evolutionary perspective.</text>
