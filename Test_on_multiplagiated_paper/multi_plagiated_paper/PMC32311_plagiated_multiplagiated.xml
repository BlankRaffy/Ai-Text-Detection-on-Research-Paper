    <text>Context: Familial and epidemiological studies have shown that diabetic (Diabetic) nephropathy is an &quot;important&quot; genetic factor in the development of diabetes, with apoE being found to be a plasma protein involved in lipoprotein metabolism. Recently, it has been suggested that the APOE gene, which is polymorphic, may be a risk factor for micro- and macrovascular complications in diabetic patients. The presence of both lower cholesterol and higher triglyceride levels in individuals with apoE2 is linked to their elevated plasma cholesterol levels, which is also associated with having a higher number of fatty acids than those with high TG levels. There is an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease. Apolipoprotein E polymorphism may influence the metabolism of lipolipids in diabetic patients. A number of recent studies have indicated that this polymorphism may be linked to a genetic predisposition for diabetic nephropathy. As such, APOE is now considered an important candidate gene for microvascular complications in Type I diabetes patients. The objective of this research was to determine the role of APOE gene polymorphism in the development of diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy in Type I diabetes patients.</text>

    <text>By describing the building blocks of protein complexes in skeletal muscle and heart, with emphasis on information about genotype-phenotype relationships, we can better understand the pathophysiology of human muscle diseases. Our recommendation is for other groups to test for the C598T DMN mutation in their human patient samples affected by muscular and cardiac diseases. The generation of desmuslin null animal models will also help us comprehend the role of this protein in muscle and cardiovascular disease.</text>
