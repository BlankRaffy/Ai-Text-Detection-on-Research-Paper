    <text>Intracellular calcium dynamics within the oocyte during fertilization is an essential trigger for normal development in all animals, with differences in spatiotemporal calcium transients between different animals such as echinoderms, fish, and frogs that have single calcium Transient; ascidians, nemerteans, or mammals that possess multiple calcium oscillations. Fertilization-induced calcium dynamics are mediated by the release of internal calcium stores by inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3). The signaling pathway between sperm-egg fusion and production of IP3 requires phospholipase C and a Src family kinases in echinoderms and ascidians, but the exact timing of these events is unclear. elegans are hermaphrodite and develop oocytes by budding from the syncytium, which then matures, induces ovary, and is fertilized in an assembly-line process. Following the nuclear envelope breakdown, approximately 6 minutes before the mature oocyte enters the couter, the leading edge of the cell to engulf a single sperm is consumed by the nucleus where eggs begin to form and meiosis I and II are initiated shortly after fertilization; in about 3 â€“ 5 min after the fertilisation process, it remains in the peritoneal fluid and pushes out of its protective uterus into the imphecated ovary. The first cleavage in embryonic development takes place around 40 minutes after fertilization. A DIC image of the posterior arm of each gonad displays the syncytial ganade, developing oocytes, spermatheca, and fertilized eggs within theuterus. In this section, we describe the dynamics of fertilizer-induced calcium dynamics in the C. elegans species (see an earlier study for a description of similar processes). The availability of potent genetic tools, such as forward and reverse genetics techniques, and a fully sequenced genome, is one reason why C. elegans may be used to study fertilization-induced calcium dynamics more effectively.</text>

    <text>In vitro testing of type 2 diabetic and healthy controls has been conducted using an improved method for assessing LDL oxidation susceptibility. A basic method could be used to compare outcomes from a greater number of general clinical laboratories, which would enable us to move towards the standardization of 'a procedure of potential clinical importance'.</text>
