The amino acid sequence of SP was determined in 1970 after being isolated from mammalian gastrointestinal tract in 1931. SP acts as an agonist at the SP receptor (SPR), known as the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1) in mammalian systems. SP activation of the SPR, a G-protein-coupled receptor, has a variety of effects in the nervous system including inhibition of the M-type K+ current (IM). The mechanistic properties of the SPR have been extensively studied in receptor-expression systems. When transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, activation of the SPR results in an increase in intracellular Ca++, accumulation of inositol phosphates and cAMP formation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2681</offset><text>The recent development of intense, photostable and pH-insensitive fluorophores, along with improvements in optical detection systems, has led to fluorophore labeling of many pharmacological agents. Fluorescent probes can be used to directly label ligand-binding sites without the use of radioactivity or antibodies. Receptor-labeling with a fluorophore-conjugated agonist provides advantages over these conventional methods. The production of antibodies to the receptor protein is not required, as the labeled agonist will bind directly to the receptor. Fluorescence rather than radioactivity can detect the labeled ligand, which provides more information on the localization of the receptor upon SP activation. In addition, labeled agonists can be used in live cells. Therefore, the use of fluorescently labeled agents may allow a more extensive investigation into various receptor functions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3575</offset><text>Molecular Probes, Inc.

Some of these advantages include the ability to label live cells and the ability to conduct receptor labeling without antibodies or radioactive ligands. Therefore, an important characteristic of the fluorescent SP analogs is their ability to bind to the SPR and to fluoresce under physiological conditions. In order to observe the direct-labeling of the SP conjugates to the SPR, CHO cells expressing the rat SPR (rSPR), were incubated with the SP analogs (100 nM) for 2 hrs at 4°C, to prevent internalization of the receptor, rinsed and fixed. Under these conditions, all of the labeled forms of SP, except for Alexa 488-SP, produced bright membrane staining (Fig. 3). Observation of transfected cells incubated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in the absence of labeled SP conjugate showed that the transfected cells had some intracellular auto-fluorescence (Fig. 3, F). The fluorophore-treated cells also show some dull intracellular fluorescence, similar to the auto-fluorescence seen in the unstained control cells. The intensity of the staining produced by the green fluorophores was compared by quantitative analysis. The intensities of the fluorescence after staining with BODIPY Fl-SP, fluorescein-SP and Oregon Green 488-SP were significantly greater (p &lt; 0.0001) than the intensity of the fluorescence of cells treated with Alexa 488-SP. Tetramethylrhodamine-SP also produced intense membrane staining. The intensity of the staining with tetramethylrhodamine-SP could not be directly compared to the others due to its different excitation and emission wavelengths.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1472-6769-1-1-3.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F3</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>7954</offset><text>Fluorescence microscopy.

It is also of importance to determine the activity of the labeled ligands in a cell that endogenously expresses the SPR. The principal neurons of bullfrog sympathetic ganglia express a SPR that has been well characterized with regard to its structure and function. The bullfrog sympathetic ganglia SPR (bfSPR) has 69% homology to the rSPR at the amino acid level. Perhaps most importantly, nine of the ten residues that have been demonstrated to be important for SP binding to mammalian receptors are conserved in the bullfrog receptor. The effects of SP and other tachykinins at the bfSPR have been previously well characterized.

If the fluorescent group does alter the properties of the ligand, it is important that these alterations be understood so that the results obtained with the labeled ligand can be correctly interpreted.

However, tetramethylrhodamine-SP was ineffective at inhibiting IM at a 100 nM concentration, but did so upon increasing the concentration to 1 μM.

Though residues 1-21 of the mouse SPR are primarily conserved in the rSPR, only 5 of the 21 residues are conserved in the bullfrog SPR. Given the importance of Lys3 in the mouse SPR, it is therefore conceivable that an alteration in the charge of the parent compound, SP, as is the case with Alexa 488-SP and tetramethylrhodamine-SP, may cause a change in the typical actions of SP. The addition of Alexa 488 causes a greater change in the charge of SP, which might inhibit proper ligand-receptor interaction and thus hinder binding of the SP analog to the SPR. Tetramethylrhodamine also alters the charge of SP, but unlike Alexa 488, the fluorophore is positively charged. Perhaps the addition a single positive charge to SP by tetramethylrhodamine does not disrupt proper ligand/receptor interactions as drastically as the multiple negative charges that Alexa 488 adds to SP.

Alexa 488 and BODIPY TR were used to label dermorphin, deltrophin, TIPP (Try-Tic-Phe-Phe) and endomorphin by adding a cysteine to each peptide at the C-terminus, followed by conjugation of the fluorophores to the cysteine residue. The investigators found that the dermorphin and deltorphin analogs had an increased binding affinity for the μ- and δ-opioid receptors, respectively, and that the biological activities of parent compounds were preserved. However, when Alexa 488 was conjugated to TIPP and endomorphin, the binding affinities of the parent compounds were decreased.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23974</offset><text>Buku et al. synthesized two fluorescent probes for the vasotocin receptor using fluorescein and tetramethylrhodamine. These investigators had previously conjugated the fluorophores to the seventh position of vasotocin, a nonapeptide, and found that it had biological activity, but that the biological activity was reduced when compared to the native compound. Therefore, the investigators conjugated the fluorophores to the ninth position and found that the analog was 10-fold more potent than the analog with the fluorophores at the seventh position. Thus, they concluded that by moving the bulky fluorophore to the end of vasotocin, and not altering an amino acid involved in binding and activation of the vasotocin receptor minimized the reduction in biological activity of the probes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24763</offset><text>In summary, our results along with those from other labs show that, in some cases, conjugation of a specific fluorescent label can be added to a peptide without altering the activity of the parent compound. In other cases, however, the activity of the original compound may be drastically altered. Therefore, the biological activity of each novel fluorophore conjugate must be analyzed. Analysis of labeled compounds should include assessment of binding and biological activity as well as brightness and stability.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>25278</offset><text>Conclusions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25290</offset><text>The results of our study show that there are dramatic differences in the function of SP labeled at the Lys3 position with different fluorophores. Alexa 488, which was the largest and added the most charged groups to SP, was unable to label the SPR and altered the biological activity of SP in live and cultured cells. Oregon Green 488 and BODIPY Fl, which are smaller and uncharged, appear to be the most useful fluorophores for labeling SP without altering the normal functions of SP at the SPR regardless of the expression system. These results suggest that Oregon Green 488-SP and BODIPY Fl-SP would be the most useful fluorescent ligands for future studies of the SPR.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>25963</offset><text>Materials and Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>25985</offset><text>Labeled peptides</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26002</offset><text>SP labeled with Alexa 488 (S-13426), BODIPY Fl (S-13425), fluorescein (S-13424), Oregon Green 488 (S-13427) or tetramethylrhodamine (S-13428) on Lys3 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), product numbers in parenthesis.

Two of the three wells from each slide were stained with 100 nM of one of the SP conjugates. The third well of each slide served as a negative control, in that the cells were incubated with PBS in the absence of a SP analog.
