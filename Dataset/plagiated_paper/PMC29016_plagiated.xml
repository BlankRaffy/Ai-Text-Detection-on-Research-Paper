Methods:

SIB, a model of icterus, was designed by a paediatric endocrinologist and was an in vitro model of SIB in porcine models of icterus. The model was controlled by the control group.

Bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents are now the primary form of treatment, while some patients still require mechanical ventilation due to their inability to respond to aggressive therapy. Mechanical ventilation may result in additional difficulty achieving adequate ventilation.

This reduces the need for comparison between controls and other systemic variables, allowing us to establish if different biological responses to stress events can occur independently.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>4695</offset><text>Methods and materials</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4717</offset><text>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the 		  Alfred I. duPont Institute of the Nemours foundation.

Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were recorded for each lung at 		  baseline while on heliox and nitrox using an infant/pediatric pulmonary 		  function computer (PeDS, Medical Associated Services, Inc., Hatfield, 		  Pennsylvania, USA), calibrated for the gas mixture being delivered to derive 		  tidal volume, resistance and compliance. Airflow data were obtained by a 		  Fleisch 0 (Pediatric) tachometer (OEM Medical, Richmond, Virginia, USA). 		  Transpulmonic pressure was measured by a differential pressure transducer with 		  an esophageal balloon. While ventilating both lungs with nitrox, methacholine 		  (10 mg/ml &#215; 1.5ml diluted to 3 ml with buffer) was aerosolized continuously to 		  both lungs simultaneously over 3 min until airway resistance of each lung at 		  least doubled from baseline. One lung was then randomized to receive nitrox and 		  the other to receive heliox. FiO2 was not adjusted to either lung, 		  but remained at 30% throughout the experiment. Pulmonary function testing was 		  performed every 2 min, alternating lungs until the resistance of one lung 		  returned to within 15% of baseline or until 16 min had elapsed. As 		  approximately 2 min was required to complete each pulmonary function assessment 		  and because of differences in calibration between the two gases used, right and 		  left lung PFTs were not obtained simultaneously. Therefore, the order for each 		  lung to be tested was determined randomly and data were compared by pulmonary 		  function assessment number. Results of PFTs obtained at 2 min and 4 min are 		  reported as assessment number 1; the results of PFTs performed at 6 min and 8 min 		  are reported as assessment number 2; the results of PFTs performed at 10 and 		  12 min as assessment number 3; and the results of PFTs performed at 14 and 16 min 		  as assessment number 4. The maximum number of PFTs performed for each lung was 		  four per lung. In eight out of 10 piglets, the lung gases were then switched 		  and PFTs were measured in each lung after 2 min. (The protocol was expanded to 		  include the crossover after the first two piglets had been studied, and three 		  piglets could not be evaluated due to severe cardiopulmonary compromise 		  requiring medication intervention during induction of bronchospasm.) To correct 		  for differences between right and left lungs in absolute values of tidal 		  volume, resistance and compliance following induced bronchospasm, outcome 		  variables are expressed as % improvement from the parameters recorded 		  immediately after bronchospasm. A deterioration of lung function was assigned a 		  negative number. Percentage improvement in tidal volume, resistance and 		  compliance after crossover were compared to the measurement immediately before 		  crossover of gases (heliox to nitrox or nitrox to heliox). Upon completion of 		  the study, animals were humanely euthanized using intravenous pentobarbital, 		  15 mg/kg and KCl, 2 mEq/kg (see timeline, Fig. 1).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>9582</offset><text>Statistical analysis</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9603</offset><text>A Student t test was used to compare lung resistance, 			 compliance and tidal volume at baseline (pre-bronchospasm), after methacholine 			 induction of bronchoscopy and after crossover.

Although heliox has been used safely for many years in 		  the pediatric population for the treatment of severe croup and upper airway 		  obstruction, it has been an uncommon treatment for severe bronchospasm. 		  The success of bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents as well as 		  inconsistent results in clinical studies have resulted in limited application 		  of heliox in the mechanically ventilated critically ill child. The complex 		  pathophysiology of asthma and the variability of disease between patients and 		  their response to therapy makes the study of a single agent during acute, 		  severe bronchospasm difficult to extrapolate to the clinical setting.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14055</offset><text>Studies have shown a variable response to heliox therapy in 		  spontaneously breathing patients with severe bronchospasm.

Studies of heliox involving mechanically ventilated 		  patients with severe bronchospasm are promising. The beneficial effects 		  demonstrated in these studies may be due to the decreasing turbulence of bulk 		  gas flow with heliox during mechanical ventilation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14599</offset><text>In mechanically ventilated patients with severe bronchospasm, the 		  improvement in ventilation during heliox therapy may be due to the mechanism by 		  which low density gases affect ventilation. Heliox and other low density gases 		  decrease turbulent gas flow by lowering the Reynolds number. The Reynolds 		  number is measured by the product of the gas velocity, airway diameter, and gas 		  density divided by viscosity. It is a unitless 		  number that predicts whether flow is turbulent or laminar. For a given set of 		  airway dimensions, turbulent flow results in a higher resistance than laminar 		  flow. In addition, mechanical ventilation may further complicate the management 		  of acute severe asthma by delivering a gas with increased velocity through a 		  narrow endotracheal tube, particularly in pediatric and neonatal patients. This 		  increases the Reynolds number, which indicates greater turbulent flow and 		  airway resistance. Adequate ventilation in mechanically ventilated patients 		  with severe bronchospasm may be more dependent on the density of the gas than 		  in spontaneously breathing patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15739</offset><text>Several studies have examined the efficacy of heliox in mechanically 		  ventilated patients with severe bronchospasm or other diseases involving 		  narrowed airways. Although these studies are small and have not included 		  children, the results have been promising. In 1990, Gluck et al. reported an immediate and significant improvement 		  in seven intubated patients with severe bronchospasm and respiratory acidosis. 		  All seven patients showed a significant improvement in pCO2 within 		  20min and six out of the seven patients showed a significant decrease in mean 		  airway pressure during volume-limited ventilation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16372</offset><text>The independent lung ventilation model of acute, severe bronchospasm 		  used in this study is unique in that it allows each animal's 		  contralateral lung to represent its own control. It eliminates the need to 		  monitor systemic arterial blood gases, global circulating mediator or hormone 		  levels and assures that the systemic milieu is identical for comparison of 		  gross outcome measures. It is recognized that the model is limited in its 		  ability to monitor and control local microcirculation. This model controls for 		  the variable macrocirculatory responses to methacholine (e.g. hemodynamic 		  status: heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, circulating epinephrine level) 		  between subjects and allows comparisons of pulmonary mechanics on heliox versus 		  nitrox gas mixtures within the same animal and during the same bronchospastic 		  event. This model allows for a clear determination of response to heliox 		  without the variable biological responses which may affect studies involving 		  separate subjects or different bronchospastic events within the same subject as 		  controls. It uses the same small (3.0) sized endotracheal tubes that might be 		  expected to clinically increase resistance to gas flow in small infants. A 15% 		  difference in pulmonary function between the lung receiving heliox and the lung 		  receiving nitrox (control) was prospectively selected as the primary outcome 		  variable suggesting a favorable response to heliox versus nitrox. It is 		  recognized that lung function measurements in human subjects can be very 		  variable and affected by many factors. Although the coefficient of variation is 		  extremely small when calibrating the PFT machine (Fleisch pneumotach) using 		  known standards within the physiologic ranges encountered in this study, 		  patient factors can introduce intra- and intersubject variability. For this reason, the calibrated PFT computer (calibrated 		  both to 70%N/30% O and 70%He/30% O) was applied serially over a relatively 		  short time span (30 min) and relative improvement/deterioration rather than 		  absolute raw numbers were selected as the primary outcome measures to be 		  compared. In addition, a 15% improvement in PFTs is generally accepted as 		  clinically significant and is well beyond the coefficient of variance for the 		  PFT computer and pneumotachometer when calibrated to a known standard on nitrox 		  or heliox gas mixture.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18836</offset><text>Of particular interest was the dramatic improvement in resistance and 		  tidal volume in all lungs after crossover from nitrox to heliox.

Limitations include the small number of subjects, wide variability in lung 		  response to methacholine challenge and inability to accurately discriminate 		  between the effect of a lower density gas on the resistance generated by the 		  endotracheal tube, large and small airways. In addition, anesthetic agents may 		  effect pulmonary function. Pentobarbital was chosen for this study because of 		  its minimal effects on pulmonary mechanics compared to inhalation or 		  alternative intravenous agents. No arterial blood gases were reported because 		  heliox and nitrox gas mixtures were given to separate lungs simultaneously and 		  therefore systemic arterial blood gases would not reflect unilateral lung 		  function or microenvironment. The assessment of right and left independent 		  pulmonary venous blood gases, although potentially useful, was beyond the scope 		  of this pilot protocol. However, documentation of the severity of bronchospasm 		  was confirmed by at least a 50% increase in total lung resistance in each lung, 		  prior to the start of the experimental therapy. Percent improvement from 		  baseline after bronchospasm was prospectively selected for outcome analysis 		  instead of comparison of raw values for lung resistance and compliance because 		  of recognition during pilot studies of wide variability between individual 		  piglets right and left lung baseline lung resistance values after methacholine 		  challenge. The crossover technique and the desire to use the fewest piglets 		  possible to demonstrate a treatment effect dictated prospective use of the 		  percentage improvement compared to baseline bronchospasm.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>21528</offset><text>Conclusion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21539</offset><text>Heliox demonstrated an improvement in pulmonary mechanics in patients with severe methacholine-induced bronchospasm and a pediatric porcine model of independent lung mechanical ventilation, as measured by helioX at the same ventilator setting.
