The largest band in the tumoral region actually comprises two transcripts that comigrate, as determined by cloning and sequencing.

RT- serves as a negative control: the reverse transcription reaction was performed without any enzyme.

This was confirmed by sequencing. In contrast, the major product of Q279R-K7 is of lower size. In this case, the &#946;-globin exons are joined together and exon 9 is skipped from the mature transcript. These results strongly argue that the Q279R mutation acts as a splicing mutation. Of importance is the presence of a small but significant amount of spliced forms containing the mutated exon 9 (Figure 4B). This observation is consistent with the presence of a low fraction of normally spliced mRNA species in the patient specimens (see above).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>14519</offset><text>Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14530</offset><text>The observation of FAH mosaicism in the liver of a HTI patient led us to suspect that reversion of one of the mutations might have occurred, as reported in patients with other mutations. This proved to be the case as confirmed by the mutation detection test in different regions of the liver. The heterozygocity pattern found in the tumoral region was no longer present in the non-tumoral normal looking section of the patient liver. The site-specific reversion of the Q279R mutation in this region was also demonstrated by direct sequencing. This event leads to both the production of normal sized FAH mRNA and expression of functional FAH, as shown by western blot and enzymatic activity measurements. FAH positive cells have been reported to show a selective growth advantage in vivo. Overturf et al. showed that the introduction of as few as 1000 normal or corrected hepatocytes in a FAH knock-out mice model led to an extensive repopulation of the liver. Therefore, in man, a reversion event might occur in a cell, which expands and forms FAH expressing nodule. The amount of FAH being expressed by those reverted cells appears to be sufficient to reduce the symptoms of HTI. Kelsey et al. showed that the expression of levels as low as 2% of the FAH level in normal liver was sufficient to rescue the lethal phenotype in the albino mouse model of HTI.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15888</offset><text>In the present patient, cancer is only present in non-FAH expressing cells. In a mouse model of HTI where the mouse lethal phenotype was rescued by gene therapy with either retroviruses or adenoviruses harboring FAH, tumors and dysplasia were always observed in FAH negative areas. This is consistent with studies showing that the toxic metabolite in HTI, FAA, is indeed mutagenic and can induce mitotic abnormalities and genome instability. FAH-negative cells may be more prone to cancer development since FAA can accumulate in these cells while restoration of FAH activity by mutation reversion should remove this toxic metabolite in the reverted cells thereby reducing the risk of carcinogenesis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16588</offset><text>The present data show that a dysfunctional allele would not be transcriptionally silenced in favor of a functional one since in the reverted region of the liver, the IVS6-1g-&gt;t transcripts are still detectable.

However, the complex pattern of transcripts obtained by RT-PCR in different regions of the liver reported here suggests that the Q279R mutation could act as a splicing mutation in vivo. In fact, we identified at least six alternative transcripts in the tumoral region and in the patient's fibroblasts (Figures 2 and 3). Four of these are produced as a result of the IVS6-1g&#8594;t mutation; among these, three are identical to those previously reported in other patients harboring this mutation. We also identified an unreported high molecular weight transcript, with a retention of intron 6, as a minor product. The Q279R mutation seems to be responsible for the other two transcripts. mRNA analysis in the compound heterozygous patient also revealed that this exon 9 mutation partially affects the splicing at the 5' splice site both in vivo and in transfected HeLa cells, whereas the IVS6-1g-&gt;t mutation seems to completely abolish the normal splicing. Among the abnormal splicing isoforms produced from either the Q279R or the IVS6-1g-&gt;t alleles, three contain premature termination codons (PTCs) and are expressed at low levels when compared to the other major in-frame mRNA transcripts (Figure 3). These PTC-containing transcripts are likely to be targeted for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18373</offset><text>The nucleotide change in the Q279R mutation (836A-&gt;G) is located at position -2 of the 5' (donor) splice site.

The A-&gt;G mutation most likely weakens the splice site, but does not completely abolish its utilization as demonstrated in the transfection experiments (Figure 4).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18729</offset><text>Structural analysis of FAH also suggested that the Gln-&gt;Arg amino acid replacement might be structurally tolerated and would not interfere with the structure as predicted by circular dichroism. Indeed functional analysis of a Q279R-containing FAH variant showed that the mutated protein was enzymatically active. Altogether, these data lead to the conclusion that while Q279R introduces a missense mutation at the cDNA level, it likely acts as a splicing mutation in vivo thereby inhibiting the production of normal FAH mRNA and the corresponding protein. This is supported by the analysis of transcripts in the liver and by the minigene assay, but it cannot be excluded that the mutation is leaky as a low amount of normal transcripts is found in both cases. Whether this low amount of FAH mRNA is translated in sufficient functional protein to alleviate the clinical phenotype remains uncertain. While FAH could not be detected in the tumor tissue by western blot analysis, the presence of low amounts of FAH undetectable by the blot assay cannot be excluded.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>19791</offset><text>Conclusion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19802</offset><text>We have analyzed several hypotheses regarding this clinical case of HTI, particularly how the patient's dietary restrictions had dropped to 14 years old, and their mild phenotype may be linked to the presence of a missense Q279R allele that disrupts in vivo mRNA splicing, as demonstrated by the pseudodeficient FAH (like R341W).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>20605</offset><text>Materials and Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>20627</offset><text>Case History</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20640</offset><text>The full clinical history of this patient is reported elsewhere.

Hence the 78-bp PCR product obtained using RT75 and the reverse primer Tan77 (5' CTG GGT TTG GGA GCT TCC TGC AGA 3') generates a 58-bp and a 20-bp fragment specifically from the mutated allele upon Msp I digestion, whereas the normal allele product remains uncleaved.

The amplification was performed as follows: 35 cycles at 95&#176;C for 30 s, 61&#176;C for 30 s and 72&#176;C for 1 min; and a final extension of 15 min at 72&#176;C.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>24449</offset><text>Minigene constructs and analysis</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24482</offset><text>A fragment surrounding exon 9 was amplified with the forward primer Tan76 (5'GCA GAT CAG CTC CAG ATT CTA ATG 3') and the reverse primer RT80 (5'GCT AGC TGG CAT GTC CAC 3') which contains a Nhe I restriction site at its 5' end. This amplification was performed on a normal individual and on the patient's genomic DNA using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Diagnostics). The conditions used were of 95&#176;C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of: 95&#176;C for 30 s, 57&#176;C for 30 s and 68&#176;C for 1 min 30 s. The last step consisted of an elongation period of 10 min at 68&#176;C. The fragment obtained was extracted from a 1% agarose gel using the UltraClean TM DNA purification kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Inc.). One microliter (1 &#956;l) of purified fragment was amplified with RT79 (5' GGT AAC CAT TGA ATG CTC TTG C 3'), which was modified at its 5' end to create a Bst EII restriction site and RT80 (see above). The PCR amplification started with a denaturation step of 5 min at 95&#176;C followed by 30 cycles of: 95&#176;C for 30 s, 56&#176;C for 30 s and 68&#176;C for 1 min. The final elongation step was of 5 min at 68&#176;C. The 387-bp expected fragment was purified from a 2% agarose gel and digested with Bst EII (New England Biolabs) and Nhe I (New England Biolabs) and cloned in K7, a minigene cassette containing human &#946;-globin exons 1 and 3 (Deguillien, M., Huang, S. C., Morini&#232;re, M., Dreumont, N., Benz, E. J. Jr and Baklouti, F., unpublished). The two minigenes obtained (Q279Q-K7 and Q279R-K7) were sequenced on a 373A DNA sequencer. One point six micrograms (1.6 &#956;g) of each construction were cotransfected with 0.4 &#956;g of pEGFP-NI (Clontech) using Lipofectamine (Gibco BRL). The efficiency of cotransfection was respectively of 20% and 30% for Q279Q-K7 and Q279R-K7. After 24 hours, cells were harvested and lysed in Trizol Reagent. Total RNA was digested with 1 &#956;l of RNase-free DNase I (Boehringer-Manheim) for 30 min at 37&#176;C. RNA was extracted for a second time with 1 ml Trizol Reagent and resuspended in 50 &#956;l of RNA storage solution (Ambion, Inc.). Reverse transcription was performed on 2 &#956;g of total RNA in a final volume of 40 &#956;l with 2 &#956;l of the M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Gibco-BRL) and 1 &#956;g of oligo (dT) 12-18, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Two microliters (2 &#956;l) of reverse transcription product were amplified using Taq polymerase (Pharmacia Biotech.). The forward primer HG1S (5' TAG CGG CCG CAT ATA AGT CAG GGA AGA GCC A 3') and the reverse primer HG3AS (5' TAT CTA GAG TTG GAC TTA GGG AAC AAA 3') are located at each extremity of the splicing cassette. The PCR amplification was performed as follows: a denaturation step of 5 min at 95&#176;C, followed by 35 cycles of: 95&#176;C for 30 s, 61&#176;C for 30 s and 72&#176;C for 1 min. The final elongation step was 10 min a 72&#176;C. The splicing products were extracted from the agarose gel and sequenced.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABBR</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>27373</offset><text>List of abbreviations used</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABBR</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27400</offset><text>FAA, fumarylacetoacetate; FAH, fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase; HTI, hereditary tyrosinemia type I; MAA, maleylacetoacetate; NMD, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay; PTC, premature termination codon; RT, reverse transcription; Sac, succinylacetone; wt, wild-type.</text></passage><passage><infon key="fpage">4641</infon><infon key="lpage">4645</infon><infon key="name_0">surname:Lindblad;given-names:B</infon><infon key="name_1">surname:Lindstedt;given-names:S</infon><infon key="name_2">surname:Steen;given-names:G</infon><infon key="pub-id_pmid">270706</infon><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="source">Proc Natl Acad Sci USA</infon><infon key="type">ref</infon><infon key="volume">74</infon><infon key="year">1977</infon><offset>27656</offset><text>On the enzymatic defects in hereditary tyrosinemia</text></passage><passage><infon key="fpage">256</infon><infon key="lpage">257</infon><infon key="name_0">surname:Tanguay;given-names:RM</infon><infon key="name_1">surname:Laberge;given-names:C</infon><infon key="name_2">surname:Lescault;given-names:A</infon><infon key="name_3">surname:Valet;given-names:JP</infon><infon key="name_4">surname:Duband;given-names:JL</infon><infon key="name_5">surname:Quenneville;given-names:Y</infon><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="source">Advances in Gene technology: Human genetic disorders (Edited by Ahmad F, Black S, Schultz J, Scott WA, Whelan WJ) Cambridge : University Press, Cambridge</infon><infon key="type">ref</infon><infon key="year">1984</infon><offset>27707</offset><text>Molecular basis of hereditary tyrosinemias: Proof of the primary defect by western blot</text></passage><passage><infon key="fpage">308</infon><infon key="lpage">316</infon><infon key="name_0">surname:Tanguay;given-names:RM</infon><infon key="name_1">surname:Valet;given-names:JP</infon><infon key="name_2">surname:Lescault;given-names:A</infon><infon key="name_3">surname:Duband;given-names:JL</infon><infon key="name_4">surname:Laberge;given-names:C</infon><infon key="name_5">surname:Lettre;given-names:F</infon><infon key="name_6">surname:Plante;given-names:M</infon><infon key="pub-id_pmid">2378356</infon><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="source">Am J Hum Genet</infon><infon key="type">ref</infon><infon key="volume">47</infon><infon key="year">1990</infon><offset>27795</offset><text>Different molecular basis for fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase deficiency in the two clinical forms of hereditary tyrosinemia (type I)</text></passage><passage><infon key="fpage">1777</infon><infon key="lpage">1805</infon><infon key="name_0">surname:Mitchell;given-names:GA</infon><infon key="name_1">surname:Grompe;given-names:M</infon><infon key="name_2">surname:Lambert;given-names:M</infon><infon key="name_3">surname:Tanguay;given-names:RM</infon><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="source">Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease, 8th Ed.
