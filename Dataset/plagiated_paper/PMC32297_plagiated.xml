Myelin is believed to be required for normal cognitive function and a variety of neurological conditions. Myelin is also thought to play a role in the formation of synapses between neurons; an important step in the process of synapse formation.

Myelin is produced in the synapses of nerve cells as electrical charges are exchanged between the axon terminals. Myelin is also required for axonal growth in the adult brain. Myelin also plays a role in the production of synapses. Myelin can be produced in several ways; in the form of protein or in the form of a complex of proteins that are part of a synapse.

Therefore, if parallel neurite growth had been observed on fixed corpus callosum or on corpus callosum in sections mounted on polyornithine, it would not have been possible to interpret the data with regard to the relative contributions of biochemical guidance cues and haptotaxis. However, since the parallel growth constraint was eliminated under these conditions, it is clear that the relevant biochemical cues were blocked. To the extent that these biochemical cues, but not haptotactic cues, were blocked by fixation or mounting on polyornithine, these data suggest that haptotaxis is insufficient to account for the parallel orientation. The fact that the neurite outgrowth was more fasciculated points to the possibility that growth-promoting and/or adhesive factors were also affected by the treatments.

It is possible that other myelin-associated inhibitors exist and contribute to parallel neurite orientation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>26244</offset><text>Do myelin-associated inhibitors influence the orientation of neurite growth in vivo?</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26329</offset><text>MAG is reportedly expressed only at the interface between axons and their myelin sheaths. If so, MAG is not accessible to axons extending within myelinated tracts without disruption of the myelin sheaths. Nogo, in contrast, is expressed on the outer surface of myelin sheaths and is, therefore, accessible to axons extending within uninjured fiber tracts. In fact, infusion of the Nogo-inactivating IN-1 Fab fragment into the vermis of the rat cerebellum induced sprouting of uninjured Purkinje cell axons suggesting that Nogo normally constrains the growth and orientation of axons. A role of Nogo in restricting the orientation of neurite growth is further supported by studies showing that IN-1-sensitive inhibitors expressed in the already-myelinated sensory tracts of the rat spinal cord appeared to restrict the position of developing corticospinal axons.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27191</offset><text>A limitation of tissue section culture is that it accounts for only two of the three dimensions normally present in vivo. However, the intent of this study was to examine the role of the parallel array of tissue elements in regulating axonal growth and the two-dimensional sections can be viewed as a sampling of this three-dimensional parallel geometry. It also cannot be ruled out that by sectioning the fiber tract, as is done in tissue section culture, that intracellular molecules may be exposed artifactually. The striking similarity to the parallel axonal growth within white matter observed from transplanted neurons in vivo, however, makes it unlikely that the pattern of neurite growth in tissue section culture is entirely due to artifactual unmasking of normally sequestered molecules or to a limitation in the available degrees of freedom. The correspondence between the orientation of neurite growth in this assay and that observed in vivo indicates that tissue section culture models the relevant tissue properties and geometry.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>28235</offset><text>Remarkable conclusions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28247</offset><text>The findings indicate that myelin may have an inhibitory effect on neurite growth, as indicated by the orienting influence of white matter.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>30118</offset><text>Materials and Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>30140</offset><text>Preparation of substrata</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30165</offset><text>Adult Sprague-Dawley rats (maintained in the University of Cincinnati vivarium in accordance with the NIH guide for the care of research animals) were deeply anesthetized using 4 ml/kg i.p. pentobarbital sodium solution (50 mg/ml; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) and decapitated.

The orientation of the tract was measured by drawing a line parallel to its edges and measuring the angle of this line using NIH Image 1.60 software. The spatial extent of the tract was marked by tracing around the perimeter of the visible tract using the polygon tool. Three subregions of the corpus callosum were analyzed separately: the horizontal segment at the midline, and the two segments oriented at roughly 45&#176; angles from points just lateral to the horizontal midline segment to the dorsal callosal apex immediately ventral to the widest portion of the cingulum. More lateral portions of the corpus callosum were avoided because of the difficulty in assessing the orientation of their composing fibers. Both the orientation of the tract and its spatial extent were recorded by an NIH Image macro program custom-made for this analysis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35668</offset><text>This image was then closed and replaced by an image of the same field showing the neurons and their neurites but not the anatomy of the section. Neurite length and orientation were then assessed. A neuron was included for analysis only if its neurite did not form fascicles with other neurites and if it was possible to visually follow the entire length of the neurite. Neurites located on the curved flexures between the previously described 3 segments of the corpus callosum were avoided since it is difficult to assign a fixed orientation to the underlying corpus callosum. Neurite length was assessed by tracing the neurite using the straight-line tool in NIH Image. The net length, i.e. the straight-line distance between the cell body and growth cone, was measured in pixels and then converted to micrometers using a known physical standard. From vector arithmetic we know that this distance is the weighted (by segment length) average of the orientations of each of the segments along the total length of the neurite. The macro program automatically determined whether the neuronal cell body was located within the polygon-delimited spatial extent of the fiber tract and excluded the neuron from the analysis if it was not. Neurite orientation was defined as the angle of the line traced over the neurite. The final measure of orientation for each neurite, the deviation from an orientation parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tract, is the acute angle between the neurite and the longitudinal axis of the tract without regard to the polarity of either. This value ranged from 0&#176; to 90&#176; where 0&#176; indicates a neurite growing in parallel with the longitudinal axis of the underlying tract and 90&#176; indicates a neurite oriented perpendicular to the tract. Analysis of neurite length and orientation were made by an observer without knowledge of which experimental group was being assessed. All statistical comparisons of neurite length were made using two-tailed, unpaired Student's t-tests. Statistical comparisons of neurite orientation were made using one-tailed, unpaired Student's t-tests.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>37775</offset><text>Myelin histochemistry</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>37797</offset><text>Sections adjacent to those used as substrata for culture were stained using the Rip immunohistochemical technique for labelling oligodendrocytes and their myelinating processes.
