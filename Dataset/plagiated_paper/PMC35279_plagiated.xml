These characteristics have been implicated in the rapid decay and restricted translation of mRNA molecules. This 3' UTR was shorter in the mouse (1.3 kb) but several portions of it exhibited a remarkably high sequence conservation when compared with the dog sequence (fig. 2). Especially, the AT-rich character and the occurence of multiple ATTTA motifs were preserved. A search in the database also identified a human sequence (DKFZp564E153, EMBL/GenBank acc. #: AL049257) presenting a very high degree of sequence conservation over 2.5 kb with the 3' part of our dog cDNA (fig. 2). The coding region of the mRNA was not contained in this human sequence and the observation of such an extended conservation of DNA sequence between UTRs from different species was unexpected. During the preparation of this manuscript, a completed human sequence appeared in the database (DKFZp761J17121, EMBL/GenBank acc. #:AL136550). The coding region was entirely conserved between dog, mouse and man, and most of the ATTTA motifs present in the dog sequence were also preserved in man (fig. 2). It may suggest that BCMP1 mRNA is indeed subjected to tight post-transcriptional controls. However, whether the presence of these sequences really confers instability to the mRNA and restricts its translation remains to be determined experimentally.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7671</offset><text>A number of EST sequences from various species which were clearly homologous to dog BCMP1 could be retrieved from the database by BLAST searches.

The presence of the mRNA was also detectable in most of the other RNA preparations but to lesser extents as compared to that found in brain RNA.

A search for the presence of protein family signatures (PfamHMM on Expasy server) revealed the occurrence in the novel protein of sequence motifs ressembling significantly to one of the two motifs specific to the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) family of proteins and to the motif specific to the claudins (fig. 4). The two identified signatures overlapped partially in the novel protein sequence. PMP22 and the related epithelial membrane proteins (EMPs), as well as the claudins, all belong to the superfamily of four-transmembrane domain (4TM) proteins. As could be expected, the search for the existence of putative transmembrane domains in the novel protein (HMMTOP on Expasy server) identified the presence of four of such domains (fig. 5). The protein thus appeared to be a novel member of this large family of proteins, somehow related to PMP22/EMPs and the claudins. As these are integral membrane proteins, and as the mRNA encoding the novel protein was predominantly found in brain, the newly identified protein was termed "brain cell membrane protein 1" (BCMP1).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1471-2164-2-3-4.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F4</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>10325</offset><text>Identification of PMP22 and Claudin family signatures in BCMP1 primary structure.

The corresponding human genomic sequence could not be found by BLAST searches against sequences available in the database. However, by using the coding region of dog BCMP1 a significant match was identified with genomic sequences assigned to human chromosome 8 (clone RP11-31H18, EMBL/GenBank acc. #: AC041003). The similarity extended from position 1 to 418 in the human cDNA sequence (fig. 2), which corresponded to the amino-terminal part of the protein up to the first extracellular loop. As an intron was found at this same position in PMP22, EMP-1 and EMP-3 genes, it appeared likely that we had identified the first coding exon of the human BCMP1 gene. PMP22, EMP-1 and EMP-3 genes all contain an additional intron separating the sequences encoding the first transmembrane domain and the first extracellular loop into two exons. This intron is clearly not present in the human BCMP1 gene. In order to clarify the location of the gene in the human genome (chromosome X or chromosome 8 ?), the GeneBridge-4 WGRH panel was used to map the sequences encoding human BCMP1 using a pair of primers directing the amplification of a 666 bp-long fragment encompassing the entire first coding exon and the exon-intron junction. It revealed that the amplified segment was located on chromosome X, 0.20 cR3000 from marker Wl-7096 and 6.51 cR3000 from marker DXS1214. This location agreed with the previous assignment of the EST sequence DKFZp564E153. It also corresponds to the cytogenetic location Xp11.4. As the DMD gene maps at Xp21.2 in m an, it is thus also close to the BCMP1 gene in this species. The chromosomal localization result revealed unambiguously the existence of a single BCMP1 locus in the human genome. As a consequence, it indicated that the sequences of the genomic clone RP11-31H18 had been inappropriately assigned to chromosome 8 instead of chromosome X in the database.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16090</offset><text>In the annotated human genome sequence available on the Ensembl server, the first coding exon of the human BCMP1 gene (gene ID:ENSG00000101959) is present in the chromosome X sequence (the sequences of clone RP11-31H18 have now been properly reassigned to chromosome X; see ContigView on Ensembl server).
