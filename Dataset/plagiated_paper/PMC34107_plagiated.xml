A large number of studies have been performed in this area and the results are very promising. This study included the assessment of the usefulness of a diagnostic test: a survey of patient preference for diagnostic techniques in the evaluation of intestinal inflammation.

Methods:

Patients were assessed for IBS using the C-reactive protein, the lactulose-glucose-glucose index, and the inflammatory bowel disease index (IBDI). The patients were divided into two groups: those who admitted to a gastroenterologist for IBS and those who did not. The IBS prevalence</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1347</offset><text>The radio labeled white cell scan has been proven to be an accurate method of diagnosing inflammatory bowel disease. In spite of this, 97% of the patients we tested for sensitivity and 100% of that for specificity were still positive after using Indium111 instead of Technetium99. This accuracy is significant because it is not based on the determination of disease activity but on its ability to accurately detect disease with minimal changes in clinical practice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3296</offset><text>We aimed to determine the clinical utility of this diagnostic intervention by further research.

We also consider whether these rank orders may differ between participants who have and have not received these tests. The other tests in the questionnaire, fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy, enteroclysis, laparotomy and stool analysis, though capable of detecting inflammation, were included in the survey principally as distractors.

The test should be reliable (i.e. repeatable), but also accurately represent the actual event or state that must be known (i.e. valid). An assessment of the radio labeled white cell scan's accuracy has already satisfied these criteria. There are limits to this accuracy. Quantitative assessment of disease activity has for the most part been unsuccessful. But as a dichotomous assessment of inflammatory bowel disease presence, and anatomic localizer of disease activity, both the initial published assessment and subsequent clinical experience have shown the WCS to be an extremely sensitive diagnostic tool. However usefulness encompasses many other parameters besides reliability and validity, some quite qualitative, such as convenience, perceived or feared pain, compliance or preference, and others more quantitative such as cost or timely retrieval of results. A test that performs well in all these areas should allocate an individual patient to a course that improves clinical outcome, the quinticential measure of usefulness. In a chronic illness such as those causing intestinal inflammation, where quantifiable absolute survival (as in cancer) is not relevant, issues such as accuracy, preference and cost become paramount in measuring usefulness. The clear preference for white cell scanning in two very different populations (Table 1, Figure 1) further establishes its usefulness in the evaluation of intestinal inflammation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1471-2288-1-5-1.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>11926</offset><text>Mean rank scores for dimensions of test preference.

The studies that have been reported comparing diagnostic tools in the colorectum have been performed in the context of colorectal cancer screening, and for the most part compared barium enema to colonoscopy. The patient preference ranks often reflected the source of the study, barium enema preference in studies reported by radiologists and colonoscopy preference reported by gastroenterologists. The amount of sedation administered during the exam varied widely in these reports and clearly effected impressions. The sedation administered to the experienced group in this report might also have been the factor that differentiated impressions of discomfort of colonoscopy between the experienced and naive groups. There was also, in a study that presented scripted descriptions of the diagnostic tests, what appeared to be prompting that favored colonoscopy over other choices. In this report we attempted to avoid this by not involving the subject in controversies having to do with test accuracy. It was stated in the preamble that the subject was to assume that all tests gave roughly equivalent diagnostic information. In the context of detection of intestinal inflammation, for all seven tests listed, this is far closer to being true than in the context of screening and diagnosis of neoplasia. In addition several tests were used principally as distractors (sigmoidoscopy, stool analysis, enteroclysis and laparotomy) in order to avoid keying the subject on the comparisons of primary interest which were white cell scan compared to barium enema and colonoscopy. In addition subjects were not told that one test might inevitably lead to another. This is of importance regarding WCS as it was not our practice to follow a positive or negative scan with a colonoscopy or barium enema unless for other clinical indications. A WCS combined with sigmoidoscopy and stool culture (often done at the first visit) was considered adequate to establish the presence of inflammatory bowel disease and initiate treatment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>14999</offset><text>Conclusion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15010</offset><text>The survey was divided into two groups to determine the appropriate level of proficiency for each exam: those who had all the tests themselves and were burdened with chronic illness, but those whose symptoms were representative of a healthy population and had no or minimal experience with the test.
