Here, we show that tetradecanol (TdCA) modulates the transcription of a TSS called GL15, which is also co-expressed in synapses of astrocytes and neuroglial cells, and that tetradecanol enhances its expression.

Under the same conditions, we also tested the expression of S100A and S100B, two Ca2+-binding proteins characteristically distributed in the central nervous system, but with different modalities: S100A is predominantly expressed in neurons, whereas S100B is normally expressed in and secreted by astroglial cells. Both undifferentiated and differentiated GL15 cells were S100B-positive (Figs 2E and 2F, respectively). A marked distribution of S100B was found in the perinuclear area, above all in the differentiated phenotype (Fig. 2F), and the undifferentiated phenotype also showed a diffuse cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 2E). In contrast, S100A was not detected (data not shown).

In the undifferentiated GL15 cells, only 70% of the cell population responded to KCl, with [Ca2+]i variations showing a kinetic shape similar to that observed for the differentiated ones, but with a lower amplitude (&#916; of [Ca2+]i increase = 1 &#177; 0.5; n = 47; trace in the box). We also tested the cell response to glutamic acid (L-glu) and ATP which, like other physiological extracellular signals, induce [Ca2+]i variation in astroglial cells via membrane-receptor systems. Starting from a concentration of 300 &#956;M, L-glu induced in 83% of undifferentiated cells a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i that regained the basal value within 4 minutes (&#916; of [Ca2+]i increase from 1 to 3.5; n = 60) (Fig. 4A). In contrast, 100% of differentiated cells were responsive to 300 &#956;M L-glu (n = 70), but with different kinetics and time-course. In fact, as shown in Fig. 4B, three different Ca2+ pathways, with the same probability percentage, were recorded in this phenotype: i) a single transient [Ca2+]i spike, ii) a [Ca2+]i variation with a shape similar to that observed in the undifferentiated phenotype, and iii) [Ca2+]i oscillations. Another physiological stimulus able to trigger an intracellular Ca2+ response in GL15 cells was the presence of 200 &#956;M ATP in the medium. While this purinergic agonist did not induce [Ca2+]i variation in the undifferentiated population (0 responsive cells out of 53 tested cells; data not shown), in the 10-day low serum-treated cells 200 &#956;M ATP caused single Ca2+ spikes or oscillations in 50% (n = 69) of the stimulated cells, with a ratio of 2:1 between the two possibilities (Figs 5A and 5B). Another important observation is that the different types of [Ca2+]i variation are derived from different involvements of intracellular Ca2+-stores. In fact, in 18% of the differentiated cells that showed Ca2+ oscillations, 200 &#956;M ATP almost completely emptied the intracellular Ca2+-stores. This was confirmed by the further addition of thapsigargin, a well-known blocker of internal store Ca2+-pumps, which caused a slight increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 5B). In contrast, if the same thapsigargin concentration was added to the cell that responded to the presence of 200 &#956;M ATP with a single spike, the alkaloid induced a large and sustained increase in Ca2+ (Fig. 5A).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16307</offset><text>Another distinctive aspect of this cell line was the presence of spontaneous Ca2+ variations, a phenomenon frequently observed in cells of astroglial origin.

Spontaneous Ca2+ variations were observed in both GL15 phenotypes. The phenomenon seemed to be independent of the presence of external Ca2+, because spontaneous [Ca2+]i variations were detectable both in the presence of 1.8 mM extracellular Ca2+ and in Ca2+-free external medium containing 5 mM EGTA (data not shown). To quantify this phenomenon, we tested more than 200 undifferentiated and differentiated cells; among these, 50% of each cell population seemed to be able to prime spontaneous intracellular Ca2+ movements.

It is well known that cx43 is the main gap-junction protein expressed by astrocytes (both in vivo and in vitro); hence, its expression could have been responsible for the GJIC observed in GL15. The immunocytochemical localization of cx43 protein was performed by confocal microscopy on GL15 cultures kept in differentiating and proliferating conditions identical to those described above. The results showed the presence of the cx43 antigen in all the GL15 populations tested; however, the antigen distribution differed between populations, and its quantity was strictly related to the GJIC extent specific to each culture condition. In the highly communicating, sub-confluent, undifferentiated cells the punctate immunopositive reaction, typical of cx43 gjs aggregates, was localized close to the plasma membrane at cell-cell contact areas (Figs 8A and 8B; see also additional data: Movie 2 for the original data used to perform this analysis). The quantity gradually decreased when the cells reached the confluence status (Fig. 8C), and almost completely disappeared in the non-communicating, confluent differentiated GL15 cells (Fig. 8D). In all cases, randomly distributed cx43-positive staining was also found in the cytoplasmic compartment of GL15 cells. This could correspond to the unphosphorylated cx43 isoform that is usually defined as non-functional. Also in this case, an inverse relation was found between the GJIC capacity of the culture and the quantity of cx43 antigen located in the cytoplasm.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1472-6793-1-4-8.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F8</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>21538</offset><text>Expression of cx43 in GL15 cells.

The results of the immunoblot analysis of cx43 expression in the various GL15 cell populations (shown in Fig. 9), confirmed the results reported above. The anti-cx43 antiserum recognised, in control samples (rat heart and IAR 203 cell line), both the functional phosphorylated (44 and 47 kDa) and the unphosphorylated (42 kDa) isoforms of the connexin, whereas in GL15 cells only a small quantity of the 42 kDa antigen was detected. This observation may explain the very low communication capacity of this cell line. The quantity of the functional phosphorylated cx43 isoform could have been, in this case, under the limit of immunoblot sensitivity. Only in the samples of GL15 cells was an upper signal sized around 50 kDa detectable. This signal is probably due to a non-specific reaction of the anti-rabbit secondary antiserum with a protein only expressed by human cells. The possibility that it was caused by a slowly migrating, altered (and non-functional) isoform of cx43, typical of this cell line, is very unlikely. If this were the case, a very high total quantity of the cx43 antigen/single GL15 cell would be expected (much more than in the case of the IAR 203 cells, used as a positive control because of their extremely high cx43 expression level). However, the data obtained by the immunolocalization of the protein showed the quantity of cx43 antigen/single cell to be very low.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1472-6793-1-4-9.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F9</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>23624</offset><text>Immunoblot analysis of cx43 protein expression in GL15 cell line 40 &#956;g of total protein extracts from undifferentiated and differentiated GL15 monolayers are electrophoresed and blotted according to Material and Methods.

Today the conception that researchers have of this cell population has completely changed, and, in general, theories concerning the role of astrocytes have been radically modified. A recent, novel hypothesis put forward the possibility that this cell type is directly involved in the activity of brain tissue, and not just as a growth-factor producer. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the observation that astrocytes display rapid electrical responses to neuronal activity and/or modifications of transductive systems, like those of extracellular purines, which are known to be active in primary cultures of astrocytes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25357</offset><text>Our experiments demonstrate that GL15 cells possess characteristics typical of astrocytes.

Under these conditions, a transient increase of [Ca2+]i was observed, similar to that obtained in other excitable cells such as neurons, muscle cells or mature astrocytes. By employing [Ca2+]i variation as an indicator for the presence of Ca2+-related receptors in these cells, it was further possible to demonstrate that the mature phenotype of GL15 cells is associated with different agonist-receptor systems. The presence of appropriate glutamate or ATP concentrations in the experimental medium induced significant [Ca2+]i variation with specifc and agonist-related characteristics. However, upon testing with undifferentiated GL15 cells, these effects were either not present (i.e. ATP-induced [Ca2+]i variation), or less marked (i.e. KCl-induced), or evident in a different way (i.e. L-glu-induced).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27082</offset><text>Our decision to examine [Ca2+]i as probe for definitive astrocytic features of GL15 cells was based on the fact that the specific role played by astrocytes in many brain functions is achieved by Ca2+ signalling mechanism(s). Astrocytes express many different pathways, through which they react to external stimuli by variation of [Ca2+]i. In fact, these cells contain different forms of inositol triphosphate-coupled receptors that increase Ca2+ signalling, for example via the glutamate pathway and purine-activated systems. Ionotropic receptors, which open Ca2+ channels, are also found in this cell type.

It is possible to record oscillations in intracellular Ca2+ levels, generated either spontaneously or in the presence of ATP or Glutamate. On the other hand, depolarising agents like 50 mM KCl are unable to induce this phenomenon, which may therefore be considered independent from the voltage-operated Ca2+ channel status. This interpretation is credible, especially considering oscillating responses were also observed when extracellular Ca2+ was absent in the experimental medium. We hypothesise from the data that in the GL15 population, Ca2+ oscillations originate during Ca2+-release from internal stores. The presence of a complete fan of receptor-operated responses in GL15 cells is correlated with the mature phenotype, whereas intercellular communication of astrocytes is associated with the immature status of GL15 cells. In vivo, astrocytes have the possibility to form 'functional syncytia' by establishing cytoplasmic connections through specific intercellular channels (gap junctions), which in turn provide pathways for the direct exchange of ions, small metabolites and water.

These data confirm that physiologically, GL15 behave like glial cells with respect to both cell-cycle-dependent and differentiation-related regulation, and astrocytic junctional coupling (cx43 expression).

This functional evidence closely reflects the data from immunocytochemical and immunoblot analyses, which indicate that in GL15 cells the junctional protein cx43 is expressed at low levels and its localization is mainly cytoplasmic, probably in the nonfunctional, unphosphorylated isoform. The presence of low levels of cx43 and limited intercellular coupling of GL15 cells is likely to be due to the neoplastic origin of this cell line, which is also observed in many other tumour-derived cell types such as C6 glioma cells. Another possible explanation for the low communication capacity of GL15 cells might be the culture conditions. It has been demonstrated that the efficiency of junctional coupling of cultured astrocytes is positively influenced by interactions with other cell types (e.g. neurons and meningeal cells). Moreover, in astrocytes (both in situ and in vitro), the different levels of dye-coupling (and cx43 expression) depend on factors such as the specific regional origin of these cells in the CNS or degree of maturation, thus suggesting that gjs formation in this cell type undergoes very complex environmental regulation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32579</offset><text>Another important feature observed in our results was the correspondence between the modality of Ca2+ wave propagation in GL15 cells, and their GJIC capacity.
