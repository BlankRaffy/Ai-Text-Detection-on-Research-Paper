After incubation with the non- fluorescent, cell-permeable derivative BCECF-AM, efficient cleavage of the AM ester by cell esterases as well as homogeneous labeling of the cells was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy (data not shown).

Then, SPB buffer/2 M sorbitol was added to a final concentration of 400 mM sorbitol and flow cytometry measurements were performed at intervals of 30 sec. The average emission ratio FL1/FL2 was calculated for each time point as a relative measure for the intracellular pH. BCECF-labeled cells, which were exposed to hyperosmotic conditions, exhibited a strong decrease in the emission ratio, indicating a decrease in pH, whereas little changes of the emission ratio of control cells suspended in SPB buffer were observed (Fig. 1A). Apparently, the major changes in emission ratio occurred during the first 1-4 min of hyperosmotic shock, whereas the decrease in the emission ratio was slowed down 5-10 min after onset of the shock. However, the observed decrease was still 4-fold bigger in shocked cells than in control cells in this time slot. This suggests, that the process of pH drop in shocked cells persists at least to T = 10 min.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1471-2121-2-9-1.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>7756</offset><text>FACS measurements using BCECF as fluorescent pH indicator show that hyperosmotic stress results in intracellular acidification (A) AX-2 cells were labeled with BCECF and were subsequently exposed to hyperosmotic stress. Fluorescence emission was determined at FL1 and FL2 by flow cytometry and the fluorescence emission ratio FL1/FL2 was calculated. The decrease in FL1/FL2 of cells exposed to hyperosmotic shock ("400 mM Sorbitol") reflects a decrease in pH. As control, the measurements were performed with cells suspended in SPB buffer. (B) Calibration of intracellular pH of cells in low osmolarity buffer. BCECF-labeled cells were suspended in calibration solutions with different Pseudo-Null pH values and FL1/FL2 was determined by flow cytometry at intervals. The solution with Pseudo-Null pH 7.3 slightly decreased FL1/FL2 compared to the control cells suspended in SPB buffer and the solution with Pseudo-Null pH 7.6 increases FL1/FL2 compared to the control. Hence, the actual intracellular pH is estimated to be pH 7.3 to pH 7.4. (C) Calibration of the pH of hyperosmotically shocked cells. After BCECF labeling, Dictyostelium cells were suspended SPB buffer and FL1/FL2 was determined at T=-13.5 min.

The solution with Pseudo-Null pH 6.7 slightly decreased FL1/FL2 compared to the control ("Sorbitol"; cells suspended in SPB buffer/400 mM sorbitol) at T = 0.5 min, before intracellular pH starts to recover.

Calibration was first performed with cells in low osmolarity buffer to determine pre-shock pH. Suspending the cells in the calibration solution with Pseudo-Null pH 7.3 caused a slight decrease in the emission ratio, whereas the calibration solution with Pseudo-Null pH 7.6 caused a distinct increase in the emission ratio, indicating that the actual intracellular pH is 7.4-7.5 (Fig. 1B). In order to determine the intracellular pH of hyperosmotically shocked cells, the cells were first shaken in high osmolarity buffer (430 mOsm) for 10 min, before the cells were centrifuged and suspended in high osmolarity calibration solutions at T = 13.5 min. The calibration solution with Pseudo-Null pH 6.7 caused a very slight decrease in the emission ratio after 0.5 min, whereas the calibration solution with Pseudo-Null pH value 7.0 caused a marked increase in the emission ratio, indicating that the actual intracellular pH is 6.7-6.8 (Fig. 1C). The intracellular pH is calibrated at T = 15 min as hyperosmotic conditions prevail during calibration. Hence, the results indicate, that the intracellular pH drops from 7.4-7.5 to 6.7-6.8 in cells exposed to hypertonic stress for 15 min.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>11074</offset><text>Hyperosmotic stress leads to cytosolic acidification, but leaves the pH of the endo-lysosomal system unaffected</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11186</offset><text>In parallel to the flow cytometry measurements, the intracellular pH drop under hypertonic conditions was investigated by 31P-NMR. This technique has the advantage, that the measurements are conducted directly on aerobic cell suspensions allowing detection of the pH with an excellent time resolution. The strong broadening of intracellular resonances induced by sorbitol addition precluded the use of intracellular Pi to measure cytosolic pH. To determine the effect of hyperosmotic shock on cytosolic and lysosomal pH, methyl phosphonate (MEP) and 2-aminoethyl phosphonate (AEP) were used as pH probes in P-NMR experiments. Previous 31P-NMR studies have established that cytosolic pH is 7.3-7.5, and that Dictyostelium cells possess an acidic lysosomal compartment at pH 4.3-4.5. The phosphonates MEP and AEP are internalized by macropinocytosis and MEP is transferred to the cytosol much more efficiently than AEP.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12104</offset><text>The 31P-NMR chemical shifts (ppm) of these phosphonates are sensitive to pH and are therefore directly related to the pH of the compartments in which they are located. AEP has a pKa of 6.3 and its chemical shift decreased from 19.1 to 16.5 ppm when the pH increased from 4.0 to 9.0. MEP has a higher pKa (7.6) and its chemical shift decreased from 24.5 to 20.6 ppm when the pH increased as above. AEP allows simultaneous measurement of cytosolic and lysosomal pH, while MEP allows more precise determination of cytosolic pH. In the case of the NMR experiments, a final theoretical osmolarity of 340 mOsm was chosen, as a higher osmolarity was not feasible for technical reasons.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12783</offset><text>As shown in Fig. 2B (see also Fig. 2A), the cytosol progressively acidified from pH 7.5 to 7.1 following addition of sorbitol to a final concentration of 300 mOsm.

Hence, the experiments show, that the acidification under hypertonic conditions can be confined to the cytosolic compartment. The decrease in pH is steady, suggesting a further decrease after 10 min of hyperosmotic shock.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1471-2121-2-9-2.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F2</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>13342</offset><text>In vivo31 P-NMR analysis of the effect of hyperosmotic shock on cytosolic pH in Dictyostelium cells (A) The sequence of 31P-NMR spectra represents a typical experiment conducted with the probe MEP.

An effect of sorbitol addition is a strong broadening of all intracellular signals which is a likely consequence of cellular shrinkage (compare T = 0 min and T = 6 min for example). Nevertheless, except for intracellular Pi (see arrow in Fig. 3A), major resonances remained easily identified. As shown in Fig. 3B, calculation of the NTP and NDP levels from the successive 31P-NMR spectra showed that the nucleoside triphosphate level decreased progressively after addition of 0.3 M sorbitol with T1/2 = 8 min. In parallel, NDP levels increased so that the total nucleotide content (NTP+NDP) remained constant. Other phosphorylated metabolites were not affected appreciably.

In summary, hyperosmotic stress leads to the cessation not only of endocytosis but also of the transport of endocytosed vesicles in Dictyostelium cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>26520</offset><text>Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26531</offset><text>Dictyostelium cells exhibit unusual stress responses under hypertonic conditions, which are mediated by cGMP and the histidine kinase homologue DokA. In this work, we identified pH changes as a novel element in osmoregulation: a intracellular pH drop induced by the hypertonic stress could be determined using two independent methods. An intracellular pH change from pH 7.4-7.5 to 6.7-6.8 was measured after exposure of the cells to 430 mOsm for 15 min by investigating Dictyostelium cells by flow cytometry. In parallel, intracellular acidification upon hyperosmotic stress could be shown by 31P-NMR, a method that allows both kinetic and compartmental analysis of the pH drop. The results demonstrate, that hyperosmolarity (330 mOsm) causes the cytosolic pH to drop progressively from pH 7.5 to 7.1 during 2-10 min after onset of the shock condition (Fig. 2B). Extrapolation of the pH drop determined by 31P-NMR to T = 15 min results in a pH of 6.8, which is in excellent agreement with the measurements performed by flow cytometry. Thus, an identical response was observed, imposing a &#916;Osm of 0.3 Osm (31P-NMR) or of 0.4 Osm (flow cytometry). This suggests, that Dictyostelium does not activate a gradual osmo-response but induces a general osmo-response when a certain threshold of &#916;Osm is exceeded. This coincides with the results of recent studies, where it could be shown that the final cell volume of shrunken Dictyostelium NC-4 strain cells is identical for &#916;Osm = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 Osm and &#916;Osm = 0.4 Osm in AX-2 strain cells. In addition to cytosolic acidification, a progressive depletion of the NTP pool and a concomitant increase in NDP content was observed by 31P-NMR. Strikingly similar effects have been described recently with Dictyostelium cells facing hypoxia, suggesting a similar mechanism: withdrawal of oxygen from Dictyostelium cells resulted both in the depletion of the NTP pool to undetectable levels at T = 15 min and in cytosolic acidification, reaching pH 6.7 at T = 15 min. This correlates with the cytosolic pH of cells exposed to hyperosmotic stress for 15 min (6.7-6.8; Fig. 1C) and with T1/2 = 8 min for the decrease in NTP content (Fig. 3B). Possibly, both hypoxia and hypertonicity lead to the downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and a concomitant accumulation of an acidic fermentation product. In addition, the decrease in the ATP/ADP ratio might as an additional factor contribute to the cytosolic acidification as the conversion of ATP to ADP and Pi results in the release of a proton. Also, the plasma membrane proton ATPase, which is responsible for pH homeostasis in Dictyostelium, is a conceivable target of hypertonicity action, as inhibition of this enzyme causes cytosolic acidification. In contrast, enhanced proton secretion was observed upon exposure of Dictyostelium cells to hyperosmotic stress, indicating that the extrusion of protons out of the cytosol still operates. Alternatively, proton secretion could be achieved by the exocytosis of acidic vesicles. However, we could show that exocytosis was totally blocked under hypertonic conditions (Fig. 4B). In addition, endo-lysosomal pH was shown to be largely unaffected by hypertonicity (Fig. 2C). This indicates, that the pH change is confined to the cytosolic compartment and is not perturbing endo-lysosomal pH. Changes in proton concentration can affect the biochemical properties of proteins. In some cases, a regulatory function could be attributed to cytosolic pH changes, indicating that a pH change can act as a signal mediating downstream responses. Generally, cytosolic acidification correlated with a decrease in activity or efficiency of cellular processes, like protein and DNA biosynthesis, glycolysis, motility and activation from dormant states. This raises the question, which might be the targets mediated by cytosolic acidification. In this work we could show, that cytosolic acidification can fully mimick the block of endocytosis observed under hypertonic conditions (Fig. 4C). In addition, cytosolic acidification partially inhibits exocytosis, which indicates, that other factors have to co-operate to achieve the total inhibition of exocytosis of cells exposed to hyperosmolar conditions. This is consistent with the concept of a pH change as a "synergistic" messenger, which acts together with other messengers to elicit the physiological responses observed. Cytoskeletal rearrangements and the subsequent inactivation of the dynamic actin system as well as energy depletion might contribute to the total inhibition of the endo-lysosomal pathway, as both bioenergetic status and the integrity of the cytoskeleton have been shown to be essential for a functional endo-lysosomal pathway (see. The enrichment of the elongation factor eEF l&#945; in the actin-rich cytoskeletal fraction of hyperosmotically stressed cells is another osmo-response which can be attributed to cytosolic acidification. It was shown recently, that eEF l&#945; exhibits increased binding to actin when pH is lowered to 6.5. This sequesters the protein from interaction with aminoacyl-tRNA which in turn affects the rate of protein biosynthesis. Dictyostelium cells endocytose fluid by macropinocytosis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31763</offset><text>At crown-shaped protrusions, extracellular medium is taken up into vesicles with an average diameter of 1.6 &#956;m. This process is dependent on coronin and F-actin, indicating that an intact cytoskeleton is a prerequisite for functional endocytosis. Clathrin-coated pits have been rarely observed in Dictyostelium cells and cannot account for the fluid-uptake rate observed. However, clathrin is essential for functional endocytosis, as fluid-phase endocytosis is reduced by 80% in cells in which clathrin heavy chain expression is impaired. It is assumed, that clathrin plays an important role in later steps of the vesicle pathway as well as for general vesicle trafficking and organization in Dictyostelium. Thus, the mechanism of vesicle budding during fluid uptake in Dictyostelium cells appears to be largely different from the mechanism of clathrin-dependent endocytosis in mammalian cells. The latter accounts for both the internalization of receptors and presumably the uptake of fluid ( and references therein). Several treatments including hypertonicity and cytosolic acidification have been shown to "selectively" inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis. However, the mechanism of action of these treatments, as well as possible pleiotropic effects of hypertonicity and cytosolic acidification are largely unknown. Both treatments cause empty microcages to bud from the plasma membrane. It is believed that this effect accounts for the inhibition of endocytosis, however, it has been reported that also various exocytic steps are affected by hypertonicity and cytosolic acidification. Hence, fluid-phase endocytosis in Dictyostelium and receptor-mediated, clathrin-dependent endocytosis in mammalian cells exhibit striking similarities, as both seemingly unrelated pathways of endocytosis are inhibited by both hypertonicity and cytosolic acidification. This raises the question whether a common mechanism underlies the inhibitory effect. Assuming that such a common mechanism exists, it can be deduced in analogy to our data, that cytosolic acidification also mediates the inhibition of endocytosis by hypertonicity in mammalian cells. In fact, evidence exists, that hypertonicity does cause cytosolic acidification in mammalian cells. A candidate target protein, which is inhibited by a lowered cytosolic pH is the uncoating ATPase, which is responsible for the dissociation of clathrin from coated vesicles. Actually, hyperosmolarity and cytosolic acidification were found to result in an enhanced cytosolic accumulation of coated vesicles presumably near the Golgi apparatus in mammalian cells, whereas the distribution of coated vesicles at the plasma membrane was not appreciably affected. This suggests, that later clathrin-dependent steps in vesicle trafficking are inhibited in mammalian cells, as would be expected for Dictyostelium cells. Our results together with previously published results demonstrate that hyperosmotic stress causes pleiotropic effects in Dictyostelium cells: hyperosmolarity results in progressive cytosolic acidification (Fig. 1C, 2B), depletion of the NTP pool (Fig. 3B), a deceleration of membrane intemalization (Fig. 5), stalling of vesicle movement (Fig. 5), relocation of cytoskeletal proteins and inactivation of the dynamic actin system. This indicates that the pleiotropic effects of hyperosmolarity severely perturb cellular physiology and lead to the establishment of a dormant state resembling the spore state; i.e., elevation of the internal osmolyte concentration, inactivation of the dynamic actin system, down- regulation of the metabolism and adoption of a compact cell shape have also been observed in the dormant spore state of Dictyostelium cells, revealing striking similarities between sporulation and the hyperosmotic stress response. Hyperosmolarity serves as a signal for spore state maintenance. We therefore suggest, that Dictyostelium cells activate a subset of spore-specific responses upon exposure to hyperosmotic stress, which are sufficient to protect themselves against prolonged hypertonic conditions. Hence, osmo-specific stress responses like compatible osmolyte accumulation or "regulatory volume increase" are not required and are therefore absent in this organism.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>36011</offset><text>Conclusion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>36022</offset><text>Our findings indicate that Dictyostelium cells under hypertonic conditions display significant internal acidification, depletion of the internal NTP pool, downregulation of vesicular mobility, block fluid-phase endocytosis, and exocellular activity acting as a signal mediator.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>36637</offset><text>Materials and methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>36659</offset><text>Growth of Dictyostelium cells</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>36689</offset><text>Dictyostelium strain AX2-214, referred to as wild type, was cultivated axenically in shaken suspension in AX medium at 21&#176;C and harvested during exponential growth.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>36855</offset><text>Hyperosmotic shock in liquid culture</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>36892</offset><text>Hyperosmotic shock experiments were performed according to Schuster et al.

CellQuest&#8482; Software was used for analysis (Becton Dickinson). For the determination of the intracellular pH value, Forward Scatter (FSC), Sideward Scatter (SSC), FL1 (530/30 nm) and FL2 (585/42 nm) were monitored. 10000 cells were analyzed during each measurement. FSC was used as trigger and BCECF retention was used to set the region of live cells during pH measurement. The determination of relative changes of intracellular pH values after onset of hyperosmotic shock was performed with AX-2 cells labeled with BCECF. A sample of 1 ml suspended in SPB buffer was analyzed three times at intervals of 30 sec by flow cytometry. Subsequently, 250 &#956;l SPB buffer/2 M sorbitol was added and the suspension was mixed thoroughly. FACS measurements were initiated after 20 sec and then at intervals of 30 sec. After data acquisition, a region including the main cell population was selected in the FSC-SSC diagram and the average value of FL1/FL2 was determined as a relative measure for pH: fluorescence emission of BCECF at FL1 is strongly dependent on pH as a strong decrease in fluorescence is observed when pH is lowered. In contrast, fluorescence emission at FL2 is weakly affected by pH, which makes FL2 suitable as pseudo-isosbestic point. In addition, BCECF has a pKa of 7.0, which makes the dye suited for measurements of the cytosolic pH. As control, the BCECF-labeled cells were suspended in 5 mM propionic acid in SPB buffer, pH 6.0, resulting in a decrease in FL1/FL2, or in 10 mM NH4Cl in SPB-buffer, pH 8.0, which resulted in an increase in FL1/FL2. It has to be pointed out that measurements by flow cytometry are unapplicable to interpret the changes in FL1/FL2 with respect to kinetics due to non-linear pH-dependence of FL1/FL2.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>40903</offset><text>Calibration of BCECF fluorescence emission ratios</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>40953</offset><text>Calibration was performed largely according to the Pseudo-Null calibration method for human cell lines, which was modified for Dictyostelium cells.

A sample of 1 ml was analyzed by flow cytometry and was subsequently centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml calibration solution S1. FACS measurements were initiated after 20 sec and after 80 sec. The same procedure was performed with calibration solutions S2-S6. After data acquisition, a region including the main cell population was selected in the FSC-SSC diagram and the average value of FL1/FL2 was calculated. In theory, the calibration solution has to be identified, that causes no change in FL1/FL2 with respect to the control. The corresponding Pseudo-Null Point pH would be identical to the intracellular pH. In practice, deviations from the control values are common. A calibration solution with a Pseudo-Null Point pH value lower than the actual intracellular pH will transiently lower the intracellular pH, which is reflected by a smaller value of FL1/FL2. Correspondingly, a calibration solution with a Pseudo-Null Point pH value higher than the actual intracellular pH will cause an increase in intracellular pH and in FL1/FL2. By comparing the effects of the various calibration solutions on FL1/FL2, the actual intracellular pH can be extrapolated.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">T1.xml</infon><infon key="id">T1</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table_caption</infon><offset>42557</offset><text>Buffers used in the Pseudo-Null Point pH determination experiment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">T1.xml</infon><infon key="id">T1</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table</infon><infon key="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
