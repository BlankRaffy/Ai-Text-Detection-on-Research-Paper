Immunofluorescence analysis of fixed cells does not differentiate between these different forms of microextensions. Furthermore, this technique shows that moesin and F-actin are not uniformly distributed and not even detectable in some instances in these structures (our unpublished results).

When expressed in NIH3T3 cells, C-moesin-GFP most prominently decorated stress fibers regardless of level of expression (Figure 1b, 1d) and regardless of whether GFP was positioned at the N- or C-terminus of the C-moesin fragment. As expected, double-staining of fixed, C-moesin-GFP transfected cells with TRITC-phalloidin yielded precisely overlapping images. The intracellular structures visualized by C-moesin-GFP also included bundles and networks of F-actin in lamellipodia. This pattern could be reproduced by staining with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin. Without any doubt, this distribution was quite distinct from the membrane distribution of full-length moesin-GFP or N-moesin-GFP fusion proteins and from the immunofluorescence localization of the endogenous protein in untransfected control cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1471-2121-1-1-1.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>6267</offset><text>C-moesin-GFP is co-localized with the microfilament cytoskeleton.

We, therefore, expected this distribution to be influenced by cytochalasin D. To investigate this, cells were treated with varying concentrations of cytochalasin D and imaged for different time periods before, during, and after exposure to the drug. Within seconds after addition of cytochalasin D, protrusive activity at cellular edges stopped as seen both by DIC and by fluorescence imaging. As time progressed, C-moesin-GFP fluorescence began to fade in membrane extensions that were attached to the substrate in a distal-to-proximal direction (Figure 6). This fading was incomplete and fluorescence remained associated with short segments and intracellular dots that varied in size and signal intensity that could be stained with phalloidin. Stress fibers also began to disappear, but this required more time than the disruption of microfilaments in microextensions. Bundles of the original stress fibers could still be recognized in a few cells 60 minutes after initiation of cytochalasin D treatment. The example in Figure 6A shows the cellular morphology by DIC and the distribution of C-moesin-GFP fluorescence in a cell treated with 20 &#956;M cytochalasin D for 60 minutes.

To appreciate the many changes in shape and in the actin cytoskeleton that take place simultaneously, even within a relatively small area of the cell surface and within short time spans time lapse recording of live cells is necessary. This method clearly visualizes the dynamic nature of changes virtually over the entire cell surface the entire of the cell surface consisting of protrusion and retraction of microspikes, filopodial and lamellipodial structures. These changes occur continuously and do not appear to be synchronized. At any given time, the cells appear irregularly shaped, with microspikes, broad lamellae, filopodia and retraction fibers extending from the main body towards the substrate, as well as others protruding from their dorsal cell surfaces. These protrusions are difficult to differentiate from one another functionally on the basis of shape alone, but time-lapse video microscopy at a focal plane near the surface of the culture dish allowed us to distinguish between growing and motile, or stable and retracting microextensions. We refer to advancing, motile and elongated microextensions as filopodia, and to fixed and static structures as retraction fibers. In the recent literature, such protrusions are summarily and often interchangeably described as filopodia, microvilli, retraction fibers, or pseudopodia without regard to potential structural or functional differences. This deficiency is particularly evident, when comparing immunofluorescence results from different laboratories, because of the complex architecture of the cell surface and the multitude of shapes of cells of different types and from different organisms.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20437</offset><text>GFP was chosen as the fluorescent tag for imaging, because we found immunofluorescence of fixed cells to inadequately convey cytoskeletal dynamics of living cells and because of limited stability of the actin cytoskeleton during fixation and staining. The tagging of GFP has been successfully applied to a large number of cytoskeletal proteins. Previous studies with ezrin-GFP showed its localization in ruffles and the leading edge of pseudopodia. Relevant to our work were also experiments in D. melanogaster with the C-terminal fragment of a moesin-related protein fused to GFP. The coding region was placed under the control of the hsp70 promoter for high level induction by heat shock of embryos. By Western blot flies with two copies of the transgene expressed detectable protein by 90 min, but 1-2 hours were required for fluorescence detection. Expression of the C-terminal domain had two early effects: 1) Upon induction, flies became paralyzed, but they soon recovered. This was thought to be caused by a temporary mechanical disruption of neuronal structures. 2) Long membrane processes appeared on specific cell surfaces within 2 hours after induction, but it could not be determined whether C-moesin stimulated growth of new structures, or whether it accumulated in normal structures that were difficult to discern by other means. Most importantly, however, the development of the embryo proceeded normally. This suggested that, at least in Drosophila, the C-moesin-GFP fusion protein did not interfere with cellular functions. In recent fibroblast experiments, however, Shaw et al. noted that the C-domain was co-localized with stress fibers by immunofluorescence in unstimulated cells, but in response to the constitutively active form of Rho, RhoAV14, abnormally long and apical processes were formed. In insect cells, overexpression of the C-domain of ezrin enhanced cell adhesion and elicited membrane spreading that was accompanied by microspike and lamelliopodial extension and the formation of unusual, microtubule-containing thin processes, up to 200 &#956;m in length. Such unusual microextensions were not observed in our experiments.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22592</offset><text>The capability for direct analysis of living cells has significant and important advantages over immunofluorescence techniques.

In our retrospective double-staining experiments we saw precise correspondence between the C-moesin-GFP fluorescence signal in the living cell and phalloidin in the same cell before, during, and after drug treatment. This strongly suggested that phalloidin and C-moesin do not compete for binding and probably occupy different binding sites on the filament.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24015</offset><text>Given the central importance of microfilament dynamics for cell movement, many attempts have been made to study actin rearrangements in vivo. Previous observations have mostly dealt with actin dynamics in lamellipodia using fluorescent analogues of actin and caged resorufin actin that were either microinjected or introduced into permeabilized cells. These studies have shown that actin monomers are added at the distal edge of lamellipodia, probably contributing to the protrusive force at the cellular edge, and that actin filaments of the cortex are treadmilling or are in constant centripetal flux. Filopodia and retraction fibers were rarely imaged, either because of choice of cell type, or because of difficulties in incorporating sufficient amount of labeled actin into sparse filaments of growing microextensions. More recent work with GFP-actin fusions, however, indicates that this probe is incorporated into filopodial tips.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24953</offset><text>Our images obtained with C-moesin-GFP indicate that cycles of microfilament protrusion and retraction occur in stationary retraction fibers, as well as in protruding and retracting microextensions. This may occur by actin polymerization or forward and backward movement of filaments, as has been observed in photoactivation experiments of fluorescent labeled actin in retraction fibers of spreading postmitotic PtK2 cells. The rate of protrusion and retraction of lamellipodia and filopodia has been measured by many authors and it varied in different cell types. The classical studies by Abercrombie et al. reported measurements of fibroblast lamellar growth ranging from stationary to 1.8 &#956;m/min. These authors also first documented that movement of the cell edge is oscillatory and is accomplished by advance and retraction of thin lamellae. The same phenomenon was observed in the movement of growth cones. Our measurements of the rates of advance and retraction of a few microextensions determined from the C-moesin-GFP images are in accord with many of these earlier observations. This implies that the C-moesin-GFP distribution fairly accurately reflects the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and that it does not interfere with filament functions in filopodia. It also suggests that C-moesin-GFP may provide a sensitive new tool for studying spatial and temporal control mechanisms that regulate the actin cytoskeleton and its interactions with the plasma membrane in small segments of the cell cortex. The Rho family-Rho-GDI system, Ca(2+) and phosphatidyl 4,5-biphosphate are prime candidates for driving cellular processes by filamentous actin. Although as yet unknown, it is quite likely that filopodia play an important role in signaling and motility of fibroblasts similar to their function in neurite outgrowth.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>26786</offset><text>Remarkable conclusions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26798</offset><text>A pattern of actin microfilaments is observed in different regions of live NIH3T3 cells, which are characterized by imaging and retrospective analysis using moesin-fused GFP.

The cloning resulted in the addition of 7 amino acid residues (RIRSRIP) at the junction between the moesin and GFP sequence. Human C-ezrin-GFP (amino acid residues 310-568) was constructed by ligating a GFP-encoding Hind III-Xma I fragment into pCR&#8482;3-ezrin that had been digested with Hind III and Xma I to delete the N-terminal portion of ezrin. Human C-radixin-GFP (amino acid residues 408-583) was made by ligating a GFP-encoding Kpn I-Pst I fragment into pCR&#8482;3-radixin that had been digested with Kpn I and Pst I to delete the N-terminal portion of radixin. The sequences of all the constructs were verified using the ABI PRISM&#8482; DYE Terminator Cycle Sequencing ready reaction Kit (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT). Plasmid DNA was prepared from Qiagen columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>28656</offset><text>Cell Culture and Electroporation</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28689</offset><text>NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (growth medium), at 37&#176;C, under 5% CO2 atmosphere. One day prior to transfection the cells were split and plated to reach 80-90% confluency on the following day. Cells were harvested and resuspended in growth medium at a concentration of 1.5-2 &#215; 107 cells / ml. Two hundred microliters of cell suspension and 10 &#956;g of plasmid DNA in 50 &#956;l of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, were mixed in a 0.4 cm electroporation cuvette (BioRad, Richmond, CA). Cells and DNA were incubated together for 10 minutes at room temperature prior to electroporation. Electroporation was carried out at 960 &#956;F, 300 V and a resistance of 100 &#937; (750 V/cm) using the BioRad Gene Pulser apparatus with capacitance extender. These conditions gave a time constant of 39-42. Immediately after electroporation cells were resuspended in growth medium and plated onto either glass coverslips (2.5 &#215; 104 cells/ cm2) for microscopic analysis, or onto 3.5 cm Falcon plastic culture dishes (Beckton Dickinson, Lincoln, NJ) for biochemical analysis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>29825</offset><text>Antibodies and Reagents</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29849</offset><text>Affinity purified polyclonal moesin specific rabbit antibodies (pAbMo) were isolated from crude pAsMoER serum by affinity chromatography as described. pAbMo and polyclonal antibodies specific for ezrin (pAsE) and radixin (pAsR) were used for immunofluorescence and immunoblotting.

Most experiments were carried out between 4-7 hours after transfection. The coverslips were transferred to a perfusion chamber on the microscope stage that held two coverslips, separated by 200 &#956;m spacers, and that allowed for exchange of medium and other reagents. The cells were viewed on a Zeiss Axiovert 35 inverted microscope with a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 100&#215; oil immersion lens and a short distance condenser. The microscope is also equipped with a heated stage, differential interference contrast (DIC) optics and epifluorescence. Filters and lightpaths were controlled with a filterwheel and shutters (Ludl Electronic Products Ltd., Hawthorne, NY). For GFP visualization, a single band excitation filter for FITC was used in combination with Pinkel#1 beamsplitter and emission filter (Chroma Technology Corp., Brattleboro, VT). Tissue culture medium without phenol red was kept warm and buffered in a CO2 incubator. The medium was replaced every 5 minutes through the perfusion chamber, and the stage temperature was kept at 37&#176;C with an automatic thermostat.
