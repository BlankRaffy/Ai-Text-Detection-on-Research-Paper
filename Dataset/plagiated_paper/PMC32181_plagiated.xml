MTX produced an immediate, concentration-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i. At the highest concentration of MTX examined (3 nM), [Ca2+]i rapidly increased within 1-2 minutes from a mean &#177; SE resting level of 63 &#177; 4 nM to an apparent [Ca2+]i value close to fura-2 saturation. We previously showed that MTX-induced activation of COP allows leakage of fura-2 from human skin fibroblasts. Thus, the apparent saturation of the fluorescence ratio observed in BAECs reflects, at least in part, a contribution from extracellular fura-2. This is particularly true at later times. Nonetheless, the major effect of increasing MTX concentration was on the rate of change of [Ca2+]i, and the apparent ED50 was approximately 0.3 nM MTX. MTX had no effect on BAEC [Ca2+]i in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (data not shown), demonstrating that MTX activates Ca2+ influx, but does not cause the mobilization of Ca2+ from internal stores. These results are similar to those obtained in human skin fibroblasts, mouse THP-1 monocytes, and human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and supports the conclusion that the MTX-activated CaNSC is ubiquitously expressed.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1472-6793-1-2-1.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>8183</offset><text>Effect of maitotoxin (MTX) on fura-2 fluorescence in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs).

After a short lag, MTX produced a biphasic, concentration-dependent increase in ethidium, YO-PRO, and POPO-3 uptake into the cells. The lag-time for a given concentration of MTX was the same for each dye (Fig 2D and 2E; first dashed lined), but the rate of dye uptake during the initial phase was inversely proportional to molecular weight. Furthermore, at the highest concentration of MTX examined, the uptake of ethidium, YO-PRO, and POPO-3 during the initial phase was linear (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that the first phase reflects activation of a large pore (i.e., activation of COP) that exhibits finite permeability for each of the dyes tested and is distinct from the CaNSC activated by MTX. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the delay between MTX addition and COP formation (i.e., vital dye uptake) is unknown. The delay, which was also observed in fibroblasts, HEK cells, and THP-1 monocytes suggests that there may be several biochemical steps between channel activation and COP formation or that the concentration of a critical second messenger must reach a threshold level before COP opens. This could explain the temperature sensitivity of vital dye uptake, previously noted for both MTX- and purinergic receptor-induced vital dye uptake. During the second phase, dye uptake was all-or-nothing and once initiated the rate of dye uptake was independent of dye molecular weight, i.e., ethidium, YO-PRO, and POPO-3 all enter the cell at the same time and at the same rate for each concentration of MTX examined. These results suggest that the second phase of dye uptake is related to cytolysis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1472-6793-1-2-2.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F2</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>10477</offset><text>Effect of MTX on vital dye uptake in BAECs.Panel A.

MTX again produced a biphasic increase in ethidium uptake into the cells. No LDH release was observed during the first phase of ethidium uptake consistent with the hypothesis that activation of COP occurs prior to release of LDH. Extracellular LDH was measurable 7 minutes after MTX addition and subsequently increased in parallel with the second phase of ethidium uptake. These results suggest that the second phase of dye uptake reflects a loss of membrane integrity and provides an explanation for the all-or-nothing uptake of ethidium, YO-PRO, and POPO-3, during this time frame. Note that more than 90% of the cell associated LDH is released within 15 minutes of MTX (0.3 nM) addition. For comparison, we previously reported that treatment of human skin fibroblasts for 10 minutes with 1 nM MTX caused release of 28% of cell-associated LDH.

It is possible that the biphasic kinetics observed reflects, at least in part, heterogeneity within the cell population. To test this hypothesis, the effect of MTX was examined at the single cell level using fluorescence microscopy (Fig 4). BAECs were sparsely seeded on glass coverslips and mounted on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope. The epifluorescence in each cell was measured using a CCD camera and image analysis software. The uptake of ethidium by single BAECs, as indicated by the change in single cell fluorescence, was biphasic (Fig 4). The rate of ethidium uptake during the first phase was concentration-dependent, but the second phase appeared to be all-or-nothing as was seen in the cuvette experiments. Likewise, the delay between addition of MTX and the second phase of ethidium uptake, although variable from cell to cell, was concentration-dependent. Thus, the overall profile observed at the single cell level recapitulated the results obtained in the population experiments. One interesting difference between the cuvette and single cell experiments is the time at which the second phase begins. As seen in Fig 2A, the second phase of dye uptake started approximately 5 minutes after addition of 1 nM MTX. At the single cell level, the second phase is clearly delayed and on average begins approximately 10-12 minutes after 1 nM MTX addition (Fig 3D). Although we do not know the reason for this difference, the population studies were performed on dispersed cells in a cuvette whereas, the single cell studies were performed on BAECs attached to glass coverslips. Thus, adherent cells may be resistant to the gross changes in membrane structure that occurs during the second phase of the response to MTX.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1472-6793-1-2-4.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F4</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>15114</offset><text>Effect of MTX on EB uptake in BAECs at the single cell level.Panels A, B, and C.

However, these studies relied on shifts in the reversal potential of whole-cell membrane currents. Although this is a sensitive technique for determining the time course of pore formation, these experiments do not eliminate the possibility that COP and the P2X channel are separate entities. In the present study, the effect of MTX on membrane permeability occurred in three distinct phases. The first phase reflects the activation of a CaNSC and a large and rapid increase in [Ca2+]i. After a short lag, the activation of COP allowed uptake of vital dyes into the cell and the lag was independent of dye molecular weight. At the highest concentration of MTX examined, dye uptake via COP was linear and inversely proportional to molecular weight. These results suggest that COP does not increase in size as a function of time, as would be predicted by the dilation or aggregation model. Furthermore, these results strongly suggest that the CaNSC and the COP are unique molecular structures.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>17016</offset><text>MTX causes biphasic membrane blebbing</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17054</offset><text>During the final phase of MTX-induced effects, there is a gross change in membrane integrity which allows rapid uptake of vital dyes, independent of dye molecular weight. This final phase is associated with release of LDH which is indicative of oncotic cell death. However, over the course of the single cell experiments we noticed that BAECs treated with MTX not only accumulate vital dyes, but also undergo an enormous reorganization of the plasma membrane to form giant membrane blebs. An example of MTX-induced membrane blebs is shown in the micrograph in Fig 5 which was obtained with Hoffman optics and simultaneous bright-field and fluorescence illumination. After 50 minutes of MTX treatment at room temperature, YO-PRO staining is prominent in the nucleus as expected, but is also visible in giant membrane blebs seen surrounding each cell in the field of view. At the present time, we do not know the composition of the membrane that comprise each bleb, or the structural features of the cell that would allow evagination or expansion of these membrane structures at specific sites on the cell surface. However, blebbing presumably requires a change in osmotic pressure within the cell and so we reasoned that the blebs may be associated with the second phase of vital dye uptake. To test this hypothesis, we compared the morphological changes at the cell surface with dye uptake at the single cell level using time-lapsed videomicroscopy. A montage showing bright-field and fluorescence image pairs is shown in Fig 6 and the complete time-lapsed video sequence is shown in Fig 1 of the Additional Data Files section (Montage.avi). As can be seen, the first phase of ethidium uptake is associated with the formation of membrane blebs (Fig 6, yellow arrows) with an average diameter of approximately 4 microns. Blebs begin to form within 3 minutes of MTX addition to the bath solution and remain at essentially a fixed size until approximately time 22 minutes. As seen in the graphic presentation of fluorescence in each cell (Fig 6, bottom right), bleb formation correlates with the initial phase of dye uptake. From time 28 to 38 minutes, the second phase of dye uptake is observed, and this phase is associated with large bleb dilation (Fig 6, red arrows). These results demonstrate that COP activity is associated with initial bleb formation, whereas LDH release (i.e., cytolysis) is associated with dramatic bleb dilation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1472-6793-1-2-5.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F5</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>19491</offset><text>MTX-induced membrane blebbing in BAECs.

By setting your video viewer to continuously loop (i.e., auto replay), and by focusing during each sequence on a single cell within the field of view, it can be seen that fluorescence increases slowly during bleb formation, but that intense rapid dye staining occurs during the bleb dilation phase. As seen in Fig 5, and in each of these videos, MTX-induced blebbing results in an enormous increase in membrane surface area which may represent stretching of the membrane or an evagination of existing caveolar structures associated with the plasmalemma of endothelial cells. Endothelial cells are also known to have an extensive system of intracellular vesicles which are used for transporting substances from the blood to the interstitial space, i.e., transcytotic vesicles. Thus, membrane blebbing could reflect a massive exocytotic event. Why this would occur at selective sites on the plasmalemma remains unknown. Interestingly, the videos show several examples of blebs forming on the surface of pre-existing blebs during the dilation phase. Thus, the structural element(s) that are required for localized evagination of membrane appears to be membrane-associated and/or "pulled" from the cytoplasm during the initial bleb formation. Irrespective of the exact mechanism, the experiments reported in the present study are the first to correlate MTX-induced vital dye uptake with alterations in cell morphology.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>22615</offset><text>MTX-induced membrane blebbing requires Ca2+</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22659</offset><text>Previous studies on human skin fibroblasts showed that MTX had no effect on [Ca2+]i, vital dye uptake, or fura-2 efflux when the cells were challenged in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Although elevating [Ca2+]i with ionomycin had no effect on vital dye uptake, preliminary experiments in which fibroblasts were loaded intracellularly with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA, showed that MTX-induced responses were significantly delayed, suggesting that a rise in [Ca2+]i is necessary, but not sufficient for MTX-induced COP formation. To determine if extracellular Ca2+ is also required for MTX-induced membrane blebbing, changes in cell morphology were correlated with ethidium uptake in the presence of Ca2+-free extracellular buffer (Fig. 7; the video showing the merged phase and fluorescence images for this experiment is given in the Additional Data Files section; see Ca-free.avi). MTX had no effect on BAECs incubated in Ca2+-free buffer. Importantly, no dye uptake or membrane blebbing was observed for 30 min after the addition of MTX to the bath solution. Subsequent readmission of Ca2+ to the bath produced an increase in ethidium uptake that again followed a biphasic time course, virtually identical to the profile observed when MTX was added to cells incubated with normal Ca2+-containing medium. As seen in Fig 7 and the video, dramatic membrane blebbing and ethidium uptake is observed 25 min after re-addition of Ca2+ to the bath. Control experiments in which Ca2+ was removed and added back to BAECs in the absence of MTX showed that these responses were dependent on the presence of MTX, i.e., no dye uptake or blebbing was detected in the absence of MTX (Fig 7). These results demonstrate that extracellular Ca2+ is necessary for MTX-induced COP formation and membrane blebbing, and suggest that both responses require Ca2+ influx and a concomitant rise in [Ca2+]i.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1472-6793-1-2-7.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F7</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>24540</offset><text>Effect of Ca2+ on EB uptake and membrane blebbing in BAECs.

Uptake of POPO-3 and YO-PRO-1 was determined as described for ethidium with excitation/emission wavelengths of 530/565 and 468/510 nm, respectively.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28969</offset><text>For single cell measurement of vital dye uptake, BAECs in complete-DMEM were sparsely seeded on circular glass coverslips and used within 2-3 days of seeding. The coverslips were mounted in temperature-controlled perfusion chambers and placed on the stage of Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope. The cells were illuminated with light from a 75 watt xenon lamp using a O-5717 filter cube obtained from Molecular Probes. Epifluorescence was recorded using a Hamamatsu intensified CCD camera (model XC-77) and images were acquired and analyzed using Image-1 software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). During each experiment, image pairs were collected at thirty second intervals. Images (8-bit gray scale) were stored as averages of sixteen video frames (phase images) or as accumulations of four video frames (fluorescent images) with shutter controllers switching between light and fluorescent illumination. The fluorescence images were used to determine dye uptake as a function of time. Using Image-1 software, regions were defined over single cells and the average fluorescence intensity of the region was quantified. The phase images were contrast enhanced using Debabelizer Pro software (Equilibrium, Sausalito, CA) and merged with the corresponding fluorescent images using Spot&#8482; camera software (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Time-lapse videos were created using Debabelizer Pro software with ethidium and YO-PRO epifluorescence displayed as red and green pseudocolor images, respectively.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>30487</offset><text>Measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30538</offset><text>Aliquots of dispersed cells (2 ml) were incubated at 37&#176;C for various lengths of time in the presence and absence of MTX.
