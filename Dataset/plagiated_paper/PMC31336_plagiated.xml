The primary aim of this work was to develop an experimental method for the synthesis of synthetic DNA repair molecules. The aim was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the synthesis of this small molecule, by the use of a novel method of DNA synthesis.

In several cases where transgenic arrays induced odd phenotypes, the authors attribute this to RNAi effects resulting from cryptic promoters on either side of the transformed gene. In the case described here, it seemed unlikely that RNAi was inducing the ALM migration or the PLM axonal morphology defects because there is no predicted protein-encoding gene in the titrating sequence. It was conceivable, however, that a small, undetected gene was present in this sequence. To test this possibility, we generated double stranded RNA that corresponded to the sequence 5' of the PstI restriction site and injected it into TU2562 animals.

We wondered whether in these animals the ALM/BDU cell division was not occurring and the progenitor of these neurons was taking on some of the character of both cells. This ALM/BDU cell might migrate anteriorly, like a BDU, and express mec-3gfp, like an ALM. To address this, we asked whether the BDU neurons were present in animals where the ALMs were displaced anteriorly. We took advantage of the fact that in pag-3 mutants, mec-3gfp is expressed in both the ALMs and in the BDUs (McDermott, J. et al., unpublished results). We crossed the pJC4 array in EA485 into a pag-3(ls20) genetic background to generate strain EA489. As a control, we crossed the integrated array in TU2562 into a pag-3(ls20) genetic background to generate strain EA363. In these strains, we measured the positions of the ALMs and BDUs. In a pag-3(ls20) background, the BDU neurons have a lower level of mec-3gfp expression than the ALM neurons so these neurons can be easily distinguished. In EA489, the BDUs were present even in animals with ALMs anterior to position 3 and they were located in their normal positions. The average position of BDUs in EA489 was 3.3 (n=50). The average position of BDUs in EA363 was 3.6 (n=50). Thus, the ALM/BDU cell divisions were taking place and the BDUs were migrating normally in these strains.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>25435</offset><text>The migration defect was cold sensitive</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25475</offset><text>To determine whether the ALM migration defect was sensitive to temperature, we grew EA471 and TU2562 at 15&#176;C, 20&#176;C and 25&#176;C.
