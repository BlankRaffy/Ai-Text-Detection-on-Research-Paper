However, the impact of these practices on antimicrobial resistance has not been fully understood despite the significant impact of antimicrobial resistance on the incidence of antimicrobial resistance. The aim of this systematic review was to review recommendations, policy and practice recommendations, and meta-analyses for the use of antimicrobial prescribing practices in South East Region of England (SEER) to achieve good antimicrobial prescribing practice.

Methods:

The review included 15 studies of antimicrobial prescribing practices across the UK and was conducted in accordance with the guidelines for systematic reviews of interventions for patients with infectious diseases published by the Cochrane Collaboration.

Reference to underpinning evidence for the statements made was sought. The authors formed an opinion of the presentation and user-friendliness of each policy from how easy it was for them, coming new to each policy, to find information. Each set of features was broken down into a series of specific items of advice or information that users might seek in the policies. These items were considered to be important enough to be included in the policies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4606</offset><text>The data were extracted by one author (PJW) and checked by the other (RTMW).

Eight trusts did not provide a policy, one teaching trust provided two policies covering three sites, and one HA provided policies for three trusts which were planning to merge. One Mental Health Trust uses its HA policy which, like other HA policies, was written for patients outside acute hospitals.

There was a perception of a lack of quality evidence to underpin policy decisions and implementation with a concern that an evidence base be worked up centrally to the benefit of all. There was consensus that the grade of evidence supporting a particular statement be indicated in the policy document. Updating policies was considered an important task with a full review at approximately two-year intervals with policies having a clear issue date and perhaps an expiry date. Concerns were expressed about the general lack of local audit underpinning policy implementation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15106</offset><text>Discussion around surgical prophylaxis raised a number of issues including lack of evidence, an appearance of defensive practice with regimes for one type of surgery being extrapolated to other surgical interventions and the need to stimulate multicentre trials to answer questions around effectiveness. In terms of ownership and target audience for policy there was a clear steer to bring this activity into the clinical governance agenda. It was agreed that authors of policies should be responsible to Drugs and Therapeutics committees in Trusts. The group considering the content of policies had a majority in favour of a mandatory status for antibiotic policies.

Some were clearly designed for ease of use, with good quality printing, contents lists and pocket sized. Some on a single sheet of A4 paper seemed to be almost too simple. Others were larger, where the policies were part of a hospital formulary or a compendium of advice for hospital doctors. In some of the larger documents, the antibiotic policy was presented in different sections referring to different specialities. The authors tried to put themselves in the position of doctors starting at the hospital trust or in general practice, and we preferred the pocket sized formats dedicated to antibiotics. The computer-based policy used in Winchester could not be compared with the paper-based policies used elsewhere, although it appeared to lie more at the large and complex end of the spectrum of styles.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17380</offset><text>The trusts that were sharing policies had done so because of mergers, either of the whole trusts or their microbiology departments. In three health districts, there was a relationship between the trust policies and the guidance given to GPs. Greater collaboration between trusts, and with health authorities would enable them to reduce the labour in producing better policies and to lessen the confusion for staff who move between hospitals. This view was also clearly stated during the workshop with the construction of the evidence base seen as an area requiring collaboration at least at regional level and possibly nationally.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18011</offset><text>Several trusts were in the process of updating their policies during this study, and some have subsequently submitted their latest drafts, this is reflected in the tables. It is important that the date that a policy is written should be prominent on the front cover, to avoid out-dated policies being used. Some trusts and health authorities regularly update their policies and this should be encouraged as good practice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18433</offset><text>Although some of the policies were conceived or written before the current emphasis on evidence-based practice, we were surprised that there were no policies which statements that were backed with references. Examples of easily available reviews are the guidance of meningococcal treatment and prophylaxis, and prophylaxis for asplenic patients. These would have provided junior doctors with more detailed information to supplement a pocket sized antibiotic policy. Given the wide possibilities for surgical prophylaxis, supporting references would be a valuable addition to the text. An evidence base needs to be developed for surgical prophylaxis that covers the vast number of potential permutations when considering type of surgical intervention, choice of antibiotic, timing and number of doses among others. It was expected that all policies would cover the common infections of the urinary and lower respiratory tracts, and that there would be guidance on the treatment of gastro-enteritis. Other infections, which were not reviewed in detail, but covered by most policies, were pharyngeal and skin infections. Most policies gave guidance on treating meningitis, but it is surprising that only approximately 50% of the policies gave useful instructions on prophylaxis for the contacts of meningitis. It is also surprising that there were some trust policies that did not cover surgical prophylaxis and it is disappointing that post-splenectomy prophylaxis was infrequently described.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19924</offset><text>The wide publicity on MRSA does not seem to have greatly affected antibiotic policies as less than a half included any statement on the subject. At the workshop following the survey, it was pointed out that trusts may have sections on MRSA in their infection control policies. MRSA policies should be explicitly mentioned in trust antibiotic policies with appropriate cross-references to other policies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20328</offset><text>It might be argued that because antibiotics are generally safe, dosage related to age is not an important issue. However two examples where this is important concerns ciprofloxacin which is contra-indicated below 12 years of age and in pregnancy; also aminoglycoside dosage is affected by age. It was evident that some policies had been prepared with a premium placed on brevity. Nevertheless, it appears that the policies should give advice on contra-indications and side effects, and on dosages appropriate to very young children and the elderly. If policies are to be useful, they should aim to cover all the important prescribing points.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20970</offset><text>One factor that merits further consideration is whether policies should be mandatory or advisory. Whilst health authority policies may have to be issued as guidance to independent contractors such as general practitioners, it appeared that trust policies were written more as advice than as firm instruction. The development of primary care trusts and clinical governance may lead to antibiotic policies becoming more directive. If this is to be acceptable, policies will have to be evidence based, and be able to stand up to scrutiny. Some research has been carried out on the place of antibiotics and attitudes towards such policies. One US based study indicated that prescribers preferred and adhered more closely to policies, which involved an educational, rather than a restrictive approach . Spending on antimicrobial drugs represents approximately 20% of drug expenditure in UK hospitals with between a quarter and a third of all patients receiving an antimicrobial agent whilst in hospital. This overview is not essentially about cost savings but there may be savings by managing antibiotics effectively. The important point is that the investment of developing sound antibiotic policies including the associated educational role has the potential to be cost effective.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22248</offset><text>While it is true that there is no absolute proof of a causative association between antibiotic use and resistance, most authorities believe the association to be 'virtually certain'.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22431</offset><text>In a working party report for the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy details of a much larger survey were reported.
