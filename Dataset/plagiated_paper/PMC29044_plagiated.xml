GBS usually affects males and females, and is characterized by the onset of acute, severe pain, fatigue, and a general state of distress. It is generally fatal.

CASE REPORT:

A 35-year-old male had a history of a history of GBS, including the occurrence of Guillain-Barr&#232; syndrome (GBS). He was admitted to the emergency department with chest pain, and was observed by his attending nurse to have a history of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1285</offset><text>A case of involvement in the sylvian artery resulting from a GBS episode, which involved both cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus, has been reported by our team.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CASE</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1454</offset><text>Case report</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CASE</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1466</offset><text>At the beginning of July 1999, a female patient (aged 27 years) was admitted to the First Neurology Department of the University Hospital of Messina, Messina, Italy, presenting with paresthesia to the distal ends of all four limbs. This was accompanied by progressive muscle weakness up through the legs, and an inability to walk, stand up and make fine movements. Diplopia presented on the day of the admission.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CASE</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1879</offset><text>The neurological examination indicated a motor-sensitive polyneuropathy (particularly motorial and predominantly myelinic), which was more evident in the lower limbs and modestly involved the upper limbs. A lumbar puncture was performed and the fluid was sent to the laboratory for chemistry and microbiology analysis, with the strong suspicion of GBS. Igs with high titre of IgM directed against cytomegaloviurus and herpes simplex virus were detected, and GBS was confirmed. A course of high-dose Igs was administered, and the patient was discharged after 5 days with little improvement.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CASE</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2469</offset><text>By the middle of the month the patient was readmitted to the Second Neurology Department, with worsening state (deep bilateral muscle hypotone, absent osteotendoneal reflexes, deep bilateral hyposteny and fever). The clinical admission diagnosis was of seventh cranial nerve deficit, deep flaccid tetraparesis (with craniocaudal gradient), superficial and deep hypoesthesia, and growing hypopallesthesia with craniocaudal gradient.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CASE</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2901</offset><text>Electromyography measurements taken at the short thumb abductor, brachial biceps and anterior tibia muscles confirmed the clinical diagnosis of GBS.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CASE</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3050</offset><text>On day 2 after the second admission, the patient manifested respiratory muscle impairment, and hypoxaemia to the point of severe dyspnoea, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit, where a second fluid sample was drawn and sent to the laboratory for chemistry and microbiology analysis. A dialysis bilumen central venous catheter was inserted, a ventilator with a bilevel positive airway pressure mode was connected, and vital parameters (electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure, central venous pressure, temperature) were monitored.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CASE</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3658</offset><text>Corticosteroids (methylprednisolone) were started at full dose (50 mg/kg per day). A course of 8 plasma exchange was performed on alternate days, but no improvement was evident. A tracheostomy was performed on the patient 1 week after the admission, to ensure airway access.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CASE</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3933</offset><text>On day 18 after the second admission, the condition of the patient worsened abruptly, with decreasing level of consciousness, culminating in difficult arousal and paralysis of the right arm. The ventilator mode was changed to intermittent positive-pressure ventilation and autonomic nervous system derangement was apparent, with moderate hypotension (mean arterial pressure 70 mmHg), and groin temperature remained above 38&#176;C.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CASE</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4361</offset><text>A cranial computed tomography scan was performed (without contrast medium), and was normal apart from calcificated basal nuclei as a sign of old inflammatory episodes. An NMR scan (with gadolinium) was performed on day 19, and showed parenchymal hyperintensity of the left deep sylvian area, suggesting a recent acute ischaemic episode. An angio-NMR scan showed the disappearance of the left sylvian artery and its branches, as occurs with a marked stenosis (Figs 1, 2 and 3). At that moment the Glasgow Coma Scale score fell to 2+3+1. The autonomic nervous system derangement required the moderate use of vasopressors (dopamine 4 &#956; g/kg per h), and electroencephalography revealed a diffuse bilateral cerebral sufferance. Spinal fluid was again drawn, and further examinations showed the presence of IgG directed against cytomegalovirus and cytomegalovirus DNA, confirming that the infection was still active.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CASE</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5273</offset><text>An immune-modulating strategy was instituted, with a course of 5s Igs, but this therapy had very poor effect, and the patient remained febrile (negative sputum and blood cultures, the patient receiving antibiotics). With the condition of the patient remaining unchanged (intermittent positive pressure ventilation, mean arterial pressure 90 mmHg, dopamine administration, Glascow Coma Scale score of 2+3+1, groin temperature &gt;38&#176;C), a new mix of Igs with high titre of IgM (Pentaglobin; Biotest GMCH, Dreieich, Germany) was employed, with impressive beneficial effects and rapid amelioration of the clinical symptoms.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CASE</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5892</offset><text>After a further few days the respiratory drive reappeared, allowing weaning of the patient from a controlled mode of ventilation to a continuous positive airway pressure-assisted spontaneous breathing mode, and to a simple assisted spontaneous breathing mode soon thereafter. Total weaning from the vasopressors was accomplished in 3 days, and reappearance of some twitching with intentional movements on the left side of the body occurred within 10 days. After 3 weeks the patient was capable of gross movements of both legs and the left arm, whereas the right arm remained paretic. Respiration was sufficient to close the tracheostomy and allowed the patient to breathe room air. On day 47, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation centre.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">cc-4-4-245-1.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>6640</offset><text>Angio-MR, assial cut: disappearance of the left sylvian artery and its branches.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">cc-4-4-245-2.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F2</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>6721</offset><text>Angio-MR, reconstruction of the Willis polygon and disappearance of the left sylvian artery.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">cc-4-4-245-3.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F3</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>6814</offset><text>Partitioned MR view of the disappearance of the left sylvian artery.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>6883</offset><text>Conclusion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6894</offset><text>Vascular dysfunction in the vascular system, known as tissue ischaemia, can result in neurological dysfunction, with varying clinical manifestations.
