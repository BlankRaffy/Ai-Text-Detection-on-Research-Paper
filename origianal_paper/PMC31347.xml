The transcriptional effects of individual NFAT family members, including NFATp, NFATc, NFAT3, NFAT4/x, and NFAT5, are beginning to emerge. For example, NFATp, NFATc, and NFAT4 participate in the activation of T and B cells. NFATc appears to be critical for proper cardiac muscle-cell differentiation, and NFAT3 functions in cardiac hypertrophy. NFAT4/x has been implicated in development of immature thymocytes. NFAT5 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of osmotic stress response genes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2354</offset><text>All NFAT proteins except NFAT5 exist as phosphoproteins and are maintained in the cytoplasm of resting cells. NFAT nuclear localization is regulated by the action of a specific phosphatase and a number of kinases. In the case of T cells, antigen stimulation elicits a calcium-dependent signaling pathway that results in the activation of calcineurin, which directly dephosphorylates NFATp in preparation for nuclear import. Once in the nucleus, NFAT can bind DNA elements in target promoters, often in association with other resident and co-induced nuclear proteins.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2921</offset><text>Sequence comparison of NFAT proteins revealed that the DNA-binding domain and a region referred to as the NFAT homology region (NHR) share sequence similarity, while other regions of the NFAT proteins share little or no sequence similarity (a schematic of NFATp is shown in Figure 1A). The DNA-binding domains are similar among all NFAT members and allow NFAT proteins to bind DNA with sequence specificity as monomers. NFAT proteins (except NFAT5) contain NHRs located N-terminal to the DNA binding domain that function to regulate nuclear localization in cells. NFAT proteins are highly phosphorylated in the NHR, and the phosphatase calcineurin binds directly to sequences in the NHR. Regions outside of the NHR and DNA binding domain are thought to contain transcriptional activation domains. For example, the N- and C-terminal regions (amino acids 1-171 and 727-927, respectively) of murine NFATp function as activation domains when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain in transient transfection assays in Jurkat cells. The C-terminal regions of NFAT proteins are unique in sequence and may be responsible for functional differences among NFAT family members.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1471-2172-1-1-1.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>4092</offset><text>Expression and purification of recombinant HA-NFATp in insect cells.

One example is the interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter, which contains five NFAT binding sites in a region spanning 250 bp upstream of the TATA box. Four of the IL-2 NFAT sites are part of composite elements consisting of NFAT and AP-1 sites that direct the cooperative binding of NFAT proteins and AP-1 components. In biochemical experiments the DNA-binding domains of NFAT proteins (with the exception of NFAT5) are sufficient for cooperative DNA-binding in association with Fos/Jun heterodimers. As supported by structural analysis of the NFAT/cJun/cFos/DNA complex, physical interactions between the DNA binding domain of NFAT and the basic leucine zipper regions of cJun and cFos enhance their interaction with DNA.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6352</offset><text>To date, biochemical analysis of NFATp and other NFAT members has been conducted using only portions and not the full-length versions of these proteins. Recovery of smaller, soluble, truncated forms of NFAT proteins is feasible relative to the more difficult task of isolating active forms of full-length NFAT proteins. Although such domain-based investigations have been constructive in studying the activity and the properties of the NFAT DNA-binding domains, a biochemical analysis of transcriptional activation and regulated nuclear association of NFAT necessitated the characterization of full-length proteins. This is mainly because the domains exhibiting the transactivation properties and those controlling nuclear association are located in regions flanking the central DNA binding domain. We therefore established protocols for expressing and purifying full-length recombinant human NFATp. Utilizing a reconstituted transcription system, we found that NFATp is a bona fide transcriptional activator and that activation requires regions of NFATp outside the DNA binding domain. In addition, we discovered that human NFATp produced in insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus is a phosphoprotein that demonstrates calcineurin-regulated association with nuclei in vitro.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>7634</offset><text>Results and Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>7657</offset><text>Expression and purification of N-terminally tagged NFATp</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7714</offset><text>We chose to begin our analysis of NFAT proteins in vitro by working with human NFATp (B isoform, amino acids 1-921, Figure 1A).

HA-NFATp was purified from baculovirus-infected Hi-five cell extracts using anti-HA affinity chromatography followed by elution with an HA-epitope peptide (Figure 1B). The expressed HA-NFATp protein was visible above background in infected Hi-five cell extracts and was efficiently depleted by the anti-HA resin (Figure 1B). This purification resulted in protein that was nearly homogeneous. We also found that HA-NFATp could be purified from cell extracts by DNA affinity chromatography using an immobilized double stranded oligonucleotide containing two high affinity NFAT binding sites, followed by elution with NaCl (Figure 1C).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>8586</offset><text>HA-NFATp binds DNA alone and cooperatively with cJun/cFos</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8644</offset><text>To test the DNA binding activity of recombinant HA-NFATp and the ability to bind DNA cooperatively with cJun/cFos we performed DNase I footprinting. We used a DNA fragment from the human IL-2 promoter that contains a high affinity NFAT site (-45 NFAT site) and a composite element consisting of a low affinity NFAT site and a low affinity AP1 site, to which the DNA binding domain of NFAT has been shown to bind cooperatively with AP-1 proteins. When increasing amounts of HA-NFATp were added to IL-2 DNA in the absence of cJun/cFos, the -45 NFAT site was protected from DNase I digestion, but as expected DNase I digestion of the composite element was unaffected (Figure 2, lanes 1-5). In other studies we found the observed equilibrium dissociation constant (obsKD) of recombinant HA-NFATp for a high affinity NFAT site (mouse IL-4 promoter) to be 1 nM (data not shown). cJun/cFos alone protected the AP-1 site of the composite element (Figure 2, lane 6). When increasing amounts of HA-NFATp were added to IL-2 DNA in the presence of cJun/cFos, clear protection of the entire composite site was observed (Figure 2, lanes 7-10).

For example, even though the NFAT sites in the DNA template used in the transcription experiments in Figures 3A and 3B were high affinity NFAT binding sites that were not part of a composite element, it remained possible that AP-1 proteins in the nuclear extract contributed to the activation observed. An analysis of the transcriptional properties unique to NFATp required the use of a reconstituted transcription system that is responsive to human NFATp, independent of AP-1 activity. To this end we used an in vitro human RNA polymerase II transcription system reconstituted from highly purified native (n) and recombinant (r) proteins, including (r)TFIIA, (r)TFIIB, (n)TFIID, (r)TFIIE, (r)TFIIF, (n)TFIIH, and (n)RNA polymerase II. Using a promoter containing five high affinity AP-1 sites we found that this transcription system responds well to recombinant cJun/cFos, but does not respond to cFos alone (Figure 3C). This experiment demonstrates that the purified transcription system is largely, if not entirely devoid of AP-1 proteins. When NFATp was added to the reconstituted transcription system it activated transcription to high levels from the DNA template containing three high affinity NFAT sites (Figure 3D). This demonstrates that NFATp is a bona fide transcriptional activator.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>14430</offset><text>Activation domains of NFATp are required for transcriptional activation in vitro</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14511</offset><text>Functional analysis of regions of murine NFATp fused to the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain using transient transfection assays detected two distinct transactivation domains within the N- and C-terminal regions of NFATp. In this study, however, transcriptional activation by NFATp was not dependent on the identified transactivation domains. The minimal DNA-binding domain of NFATp was sufficient to stimulate reporter gene activation, presumably by recruitment of endogenous AP-1 components through cooperative DNA binding. It is not possible to assess the true transactivation function of NFAT proteins in reporter assays that use a promoter comprised of NFAT/AP-1 composite elements in cells with high levels of endogenous AP-1 proteins. Our finding that recombinant HA-NFATp activates transcription in a reconstituted transcription system provided compelling evidence that NFATp is a bona fide activator. If NFATp acted alone to stimulate transcription in the reconstituted transcription system then the activation we observed would be dependent on the activation domains of NFATp. We therefore applied in vitro biochemical methods for the characterization of NFATp functional domains.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15699</offset><text>Recombinant baculoviruses were created for the expression of full-length NFATp (amino acids 1-921) and the minimal DNA binding domain of NFATp (amino acids 391-583) fused to GST.

When T cells are stimulated, NFATp is dephosphorylated by calcineurin and it migrates farther on SDS gels than its phosphorylated counterpart. Similarly, when NFATp is purified from unstimulated T cells and subsequently dephosphorylated by calcineurin in vitro, its migration on SDS gels increases (i.e. its apparent molecular weight decreases). Most of the many phosphorylation sites in NFATp are in the N-terminal region of the protein. Upon purifying recombinant HA-NFATp, we noticed that the protein migrated at an apparent molecular weight similar to the native NFATp in unstimulated T cells (approximately 140 kD when compared to size standards). This led us to hypothesize that the recombinant HA-NFATp purified from baculovirus infected insect cells was phosphorylated. To test this hypothesis and to determine if phosphorylation of a distinct region of HA-NFATp was responsible for aberrant migration in SDS gels, we expressed and purified full-length HA-NFATp and three deletions: HA-NFATp(331-921), HA-NFATp(1-722), and HA-NFATp(331-722). All four proteins were expressed in insect cells from recombinant baculoviruses, purified by anti-HA affinity chromatography, and eluted with HA-epitope peptide. After purification we treated the four proteins with a combination of calcineurin and calmodulin to remove phosphates attached to serines and threonines on the recombinant proteins. The phosphatase treated proteins as well as mock treated controls were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. As shown in Figure 5A, the apparent molecular weight of full-length HA-NFATp was significantly decreased by the phosphatase treatment, demonstrating that recombinant HA-NFATp purified from insect cells is phosphorylated. The shift in migration of HA-NFATp was dependent on both calcineurin and calmodulin, and was not efficiently produced with other phosphatases (data not shown). Of the three deletion proteins, only HA-NFATp(1-722) showed a change in migration upon phosphatase treatment; the positions at which both HA-NFATp(331-921) and HA-NFATp(331-722) migrated on SDS gels were not affected by phosphatase treatment. Thus, the N-terminal region of NFATp (amino acids 1-330) was required to observe a phosphorylation-dependent decrease in migration of the recombinant HA-NFATp. This suggested that the major phosphorylation sites on insect cell produced NFATp were in the N-terminal region, as is the case for native NFATp in mammalian T cells. This was confirmed by performing mass spectrometry on peptides recovered from a tryptic digest of recombinant NFATp (W. Clements and J. Goodrich, unpublished data).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1471-2172-1-1-5.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F5</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>21240</offset><text>Recombinant HA-NFATp is phosphorylated and displays regulated nuclear association in vitro.

Nuclei were prepared from HeLa cells. HA-NFATp was either treated with calcineurin and calmodulin or mock treated, and the two proteins were then mixed with the nuclei.

The nuclei were washed, and protein associated with the nuclei as well as protein in the supernatants was solubilized in SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by protein immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. As shown in Figure 5B, the majority of phosphorylated HA-NFATp was found in the supernatant and not in the pellet, while approximately 50% of the dephosphorylated NFATp was found associated with nuclei. Moreover, when HA-NFATp(331-722), which was not highly phosphorylated, was tested in the nuclei-association assay it was primarily found in the pellet with the nuclei, regardless of whether it was treated with calcineurin or not (data not shown).

Ruppert and R. Tjian) digested with Spe I and EcoR I. pBS-KS+-NFATp(NdeI), which has an Nde I site, containing the NFATp translational start site ATG, was generated in two steps. A region of NFATp spanning the translational start site ATG and an internal Mro I restriction site was amplified by PCR, creating a product with an Nde I site at the translational start site ATG as well as an upstream Xba I site. The PCR product was digested with Xba I and Mro I and ligated into pBS-KS+-NFATp that had been digested with Xba I and Mro I. pVL1392-HAX-NFATp(1-722) was made by subcloning a Nde I - Msc I fragment from pBS-KS+-NFATp(NdeI) into the Nde I and Sma I sites of pVL1392-HAX. pVL1393-HAX-NFATp(331-921) was made by digesting pBS-KS+-NFATp with SgrA I and filling in the overhang by treatment with Klenow. After further digestion with EcoR I, the NFAT DNA fragment was isolated and ligated into the Sma I and EcoR I sites of pVL1393HAX.
