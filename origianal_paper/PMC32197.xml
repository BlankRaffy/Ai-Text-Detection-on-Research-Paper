In most cells, unliganded glucocorticoid receptors (GR) reside predominately in the cytoplasm, where they exist as a heteromeric complex comprised minimally of GR, 90-kDa and 70-kDa heat shock proteins (hsp90 and hsp70). Other proteins (i.e. p60/Hop, p23, hsp40, FKBP52, and FKBP51) have been implicated in the assembly/stabilization of the GR-hsp90-hsp70-complex in a form that has high affinity for agonist [for review, see Ref. ]. Upon agonist binding, the complex undergoes a transformation, and the ligand bound GR translocates into to the nucleus in a manner that is determined by a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) contained in the receptor. There the GR acts as a ligand-activated transcriptional stimulator or repressor of primary response genes by binding to glucocorticoid hormone-responsive elements (GRE) contained in the promoter regions of steroid-responsive genes and either facilitating or repressing the formation of an active transcriptional complex.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2963</offset><text>Although little is known about the molecular machinery that regulates steroid receptor movement through the cytoplasm and into the nucleus, several studies suggest that movement is influenced by reversible phosphorylation. Evidence for this originated from the studies of Qi et al., which revealed that the hormone insensitivity produced by cellular transformation with v-mos (a serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as an oncogene) results from both a decrease in the nuclear retention of liganded receptor and a decrease in the reutilization of GR protein that cycles back into the cytoplasm. Subsequently, DeFranco et al. reported that treatment with okadaic acid, a potent ser/thr protein phosphatase inhibitor, also results in inefficient nuclear retention of agonist-bound GR and the cytoplasmic &quot;trapping&quot; of GR in a form that is unable to &quot;recycle&quot;. Recent studies with okadaic acid suggest phosphorylation alters the high affinity binding of GR to hsp-90, and that an intact cytoskeleton is required for ligand-activated GR translocation through the cytoplasm to the nucleus.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4052</offset><text>The ability of okadaic acid to influence the intracellular partitioning of GR suggests that an okadaic acid sensitive ser/thr protein phosphatase (PPase) participates in the regulation of GR movement. In vitro, okadaic acid acts as a potent inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases type 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A). Accordingly, many of the effects produced by the treatment of cells with okadaic acid have been attributed to the inhibition of these two enzymes. However, due to toxicity and solubility constraints, in living cells it is difficult to distinguish the actions of PP2A from those of PP1 using okadaic acid. Furthermore, in humans, it is now clear that there are four isoforms of PP1 [PP1α, PP1δ, PP1γ1 and PP1γ2, two isoforms of PP2A (PP2A α and PP2Aβ) and four structurally related phosphatases, PP4, PP5, PP6 and PP7. Although detailed dose-response studies have not been reported for native PP5, PP6 and PP7, studies with PP4 and recombinant PP5 indicate they are also sensitive to okadaic acid. Like calcineurin (PP2B) and PP2C, PP7 is apparently insensitive to inhibition by okadaic acid.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5187</offset><text>Recent studies indicate that PP5 associates with the GR-hsp90 complex suggesting that PP5 may influence the actions of GRs. However, studying the cellular roles of PP5 has proven difficult, in part, because no physiological substrates for PP5 have been identified. In addition, in crude cell homogenates PP5 resides predominately in an inactive state that represents &lt;1% of the measurable PPase activity. To characterize the cellular roles of PP5 we have, therefore, developed chimeric antisense 2'-O-(2-methoxy) ethylphosphothioate oligonucleotides capable of inhibiting the expression of human PP5 at nanomolar concentrations. Because the lead compound targeting PP5 (ISIS 15534) acts via RNAase H mediated degradation, studies with ISIS 15534 do not allow us to assess how rapid changes in PP5 activity affect cellular functions (Northern analysis indicate that it takes ~ 6 for the mRNA degradation to occur and, due to the half-life of the preexisting protein, it takes ~ 24 hours for the protein levels to fall. Nonetheless, ISIS 15534 potently inhibits the expression of PP5 in cultured cells for ~ 48-72 hours (IC50 of &lt;75 nm), which affords a ~ 24-48 hour window in which the expression of PP5 is essentially ablated. More importantly, because ISIS 15534 has no effect on the structurally related PPases, it can be employed to specifically inhibit the actions of PP5 by suppressing PP5 protein levels in cultured human cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6622</offset><text>To assess the role of PP5 in the regulation of GR-mediated events, binding studies were conducted with [3H]dexamethasone before and after ISIS 15534-mediated suppression of PP5 expression. These studies revealed that the suppression of PP5 expression had no apparent effect on dexamethasone binding, suggesting that PP5 does not affect the formation of the high-affinity ligand binding complex or hormone binding to the GR. In contrast, mobility gel-shift analysis revealed that treatment with ISIS 15534 produces a marked increase in the association of GR with GRE-containing DNA, and transient transfection studies employing a GR-responsive reporter plasmid revealed that the suppression of PP5 expression activates GR-dependent transcription in the absence of hormone. When A549 cells were treated with ISIS 15534 and then dexamethasone, the effect was additive, with maximal dexamethasone induced luciferase activity ~ 10 times greater than the maximal dexamethasone-induced response attainable in the presence of PP5. Together, these studies indicate that PP5 acts as a suppressor of GR-induced transcription.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7737</offset><text>To further characterize the mechanism by which PP5 affects GR function, in the present study we employed a GR-GFP fusion protein and fluorescent microscopy to follow the movement of GR in cells treated with dexamethasone and ISIS 15534.

However, as seen in Figure 1, the dephosphorylation of phosphohistone by the catalytic subunit of purified PP5 from bovine brain is also potently inhibited by okadaic acid. Okadaic acid inhibits the activity of PP5 in a dose-dependent manner, having an IC50 of 5.58 +/- 0.41 nM. Under identical assay conditions, okadaic acid is a more potent inhibitor of PP2A (IC50~ 0.05 nM) and weaker inhibitor of PP1 (IC50~ 45 nM). However, the activity of PP5 against histone (865 +/- 31 nMoles Pi/min/mg protein) is less than that of PP2A. Therefore, whereas assays conducted with PP1 and PP2A were conducted with a concentration of enzyme that is diluted below the titration endpoint (defined as the concentration of enzyme after which further dilution no longer affects the IC50) because the activity of PP5 upon further dilution was below that necessary for accurate quantification, we could not establish a clear titration endpoint with PP5. Based on titration studies with microcystin-LR to estimate the actual amount of PP5 in the reaction, an estimate of the Ki for okadaic acid is 4.07 +/- 0.16 nM. Still, it should be kept in mind that the true Ki may be slightly lower. Nonetheless, it is clear that PP5 is sensitive to inhibition by okadaic acid at the concentrations that also affects the activity of PP1 and PP2A. Therefore, when okadaic acid is employed to treat cells at a concentration of &gt;1-5 nM, the activity of PP5 is also affected.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1471-2121-2-6-1.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>9762</offset><text>Inhibition of PP5 by okadaic acid.

In these studies the GR-GFP used was derived from the fusion of GFP to a GR mutant that retained the ability to bind agonist, translocate to the nucleus, and bind DNA, but lacked transactivation activity. When plasmids expressing the GR-GFP were injected into the nuclei of cells and the cells were grown in serum-containing medium, the majority of the expressed GR-GFP localized to the nuclei of the injected cells, as expected due to the presence of glucocorticoids in the serum. Thus, after microinjection, the cells were grown in medium supplemented with serum for 4 to 6 hours and then serum starved overnight to cause the redistribution of GR-GFP. In the absence of serum, GR-GFP localized throughout the cells, with equal intensity in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). Upon treatment of these cells with dexamethasone (500 nM for 30 minutes) the GR-GFP efficiently translocated to the nucleus. To assess the role of PP5 in the intracellular partitioning of GR, cells were treated with ISIS 15534 or a mismatched control (ISIS 15521) at a concentration of 500 nM, which essentially ablates PP5 expression in A549 cells after 24 hours. Approximately 24 hours after antisense treatment, the cells were microinjected with pGR(Ala)-GFP and subjected to serum-starvation as described above. In cells treated with the mismatch control prior to microinjection, GR-GFP expression was indistinguishable from that in untreated cells: GR-GFP was distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure 2A). In contrast, following treatment with ISIS 15534, GR-GFP was localized in the nucleus without dexamethasone treatment. The percentage of cells displaying predominantly nuclear GR-GFP or cytoplasmic GR-GFP from 4 independent experiments were tabulated and are presented in Figure 2B. In control cells in the absence of dexamethasone, 10% of the cells showed nuclear&gt;cytoplasmic localization of GR-GFP. Similarly, 20% of the cells treated with mismatch oligonucleotide displayed greater nuclear than cytoplasmic localization of GR-GFP. By contrast, the percentage of cells showing more nuclear than cytoplasmic distribution of GR-GFP was ~ 93%, ~ 88% and ~ 98% in cells treated with either dexamethasone, ISIS 15534, or ISIS 15534 and dexamethasone, respectively. These results suggest that PP5 plays a role in the nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning of GR.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1471-2121-2-6-2.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F2</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>12890</offset><text>Effects of ISIS 15534 and dexamethasone on the subcellular distribution of GR-GFP.A.

Alternatively, PP5 could have a more global role, possibly regulating entire nuclear transport pathways. To test the latter, the effect of PP5 suppression on the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of another transcription factor, NFAT, was investigated. In these studies, a stable GFP-NFAT expressing HeLa cell line was employed. As seen in Figure 3, in the absence of any drug, the GFP-NFAT protein is localized entirely within the cytoplasm. Upon treatment with the calcium ionophore ionomycin, GFP-NFAT translocates rapidly to the nucleus. The fusion protein then relocates to the cytoplasm if the drug is washed out of the cells for 6 hours. When the GFP-NFAT HeLa cells were treated with ISIS 15534, the distribution of GFP-NFAT was indistinguishable from untreated cells or cells treated with mismatched control oligonucleotides. Northern analysis confirmed the ability of ISIS 15534 to suppress PP5 expression in Hela cells. Therefore, the results indicate that suppression of PP5 expression does not have a global effect on all nuclear shuttling proteins.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1471-2121-2-6-3.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F3</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>15442</offset><text>Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of GFP-NFAT.A) GFP-NFAT expressing HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips and either left untreated (control) or treated with ISIS 15534 or the mismatched control (ISIS 15521) as described in Materials and Methods.

First, dexamethasone-induced transcription is markedly enhanced when the expression of PP5 is suppressed by treatment with ISIS 15534. Second, both co-immunoprecipitation studies and studies with mutant forms of PP5 indicate that PP5 associates with the GR-hsp90 complex. However, binding assays revealed that the suppression of PP5 expression has no apparent effect on [3H]dexamethasone binding. Therefore, PP5 appears to act as a suppressor of GR-induced gene expression via a mechanism that does not alter receptor number or the binding of hormone to the GR. To further characterize the relationship between PP5 and GR, in the present study we employed a GR-GFP fusion protein to track the movement of GRs in A549 cells following treatment with hormones or ISIS 15534. These studies revealed that in the absence of glucocorticoids, GR-GFP localized mainly in the cytoplasm. As expected, treatment with dexamethasone results in the efficient translocation of GR-GFPs into the nucleus. Nuclear accumulation of GR-GFP was also observed when the expression of PP5 was suppressed by treatment with ISIS 15534 after ~ 24 hours. This translocation of GR-GFP occurred without the addition of glucocorticoids and in the presence of serum free media. Thus, in the absence of physiological concentrations of PP5, GRs accumulate in the nucleus of A549 cells. This finding is consistent with data obtained from gel-shift analysis and transfection studies conducted with GR-reporter plasmids, where a decrease in PP5 levels facilitates the association of GR with DNA and produces an increase in GR-transactivation. Together, these studies suggest that the increase in GR-induced transcriptional activity observed when the expression of PP5 is suppressed by treatment with ISIS 15534 results from the nuclear accumulation of GR.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19007</offset><text>The mechanism by which PP5 suppresses the nuclear accumulation of GR is not clear.

Assays, 80 μl total volume, containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 100 μM oleic acid (assay buffer) and [32P]phosphoprotein (1-2 μM PO4), were conducted at 37°C as described previously using PP5 purified from bovine brain. The serine/threonine protein phosphatase type 5 (PP5) was purified from bovine brain according to the following procedure: a bovine brain was homogenized in ~ 3 volumes of buffer A (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 4°C, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM PMSF and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol) and subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 g for 40 min. followed by a 45%-60% ammonium sulfate fractionation of the supernatant. The pellets from the ammonium sulfate fractionation were resuspended in 60 ml of buffer B (20 mM HEPES pH 8.5 4°C, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol), desalted on a G-25 sephadex column equilibrated with buffer B, then subjected to sequential chromatography on a 5 ml HiTrap Heparin column (Pharmacia), a 5 ml HiTrap Q column (Pharmacia) and a HiTrap SP column (Pharmacia) respectively. The eluate from the SP column was then diluted 5-fold with buffer C (20 mM tris pH 8.5, 1 mM EDTA and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol) and subjected to anion-exchange chromatography on a BioScale Q column (2 ml from BioRad). All steps in the purification procedure were performed at 4°C except for the last step which was performed at 23°C. PP5 activity was followed during the purification by assaying for trypsin-stimulated phosphohydrolase activity at 37°C vs. p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 200 μl reactions containing: 25 mM tris pH 8.3, 25 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 10 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26852</offset><text>Dephosphorylation reactions were routinely conducted for 10 minutes and initiated with the addition of substrate. The dephosphorylation of substrate was kept to less than 10 % of the total phosphorylated substrate, and the reaction was linear with respect to enzyme concentration and time. [32P]phosphate liberated by the enzymes was extracted as a phosphomolybdate complex and measured according to the methods of Killilea et al..
