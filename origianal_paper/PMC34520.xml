However, the interaction between this organism and the host cell is not well understood. The target cell for P. carinii is believed to be the type I pneumocyte. After contact with the type I pneumocyte, P. carinii trophozoites anchor themselves to the host cell. It was found that the major surface glycoprotein of P. carinii up-regulates the expression of integrins on the surface of cultured lung cells to facilitate this attachment.

The major surface glycoprotein of P. carinii has been shown to be a chemotactic factor for macrophages and monocytes in vitro. The interaction of alveolar macrophages with P. carinii is mediated by fibronectin. P. carinii organisms are phagocytized when they bind to mannose receptors on the surface of macrophages. Alveolar macrophages have been shown to release TNF-α, prostaglandin E2, and leukotriene B4 upon interaction with P. carinii. These compounds are potent modulators of pulmonary inflammation and lung injury. These are early and important events in the acute response to infection and clearance of P. carinii organisms from the lung.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3034</offset><text>Although it is not certain whether P. carinii organisms attach to type II pneumocytes, type II pneumocytes do respond to P. carinii infections.

Type II pneumocytes have been shown to increase the production of surfactant protein-A (SP-A) in patients with P. carinii pneumonia (PcP), and the increase of SP-A correlates with the organism load in the lung.

Human embryonic lung (HEL) cells were used as host cells and were inoculated with lung homogenate of dexamethasone-immunosuppressed and P. carinii-infected rats. A separate set of HEL cell cultures was inoculated with lung homogenate of dexamethasone-immunosuppressed, non-infected rats to serve as non-infected (mock-infected) control. Several PCR product bands were seen in the P. carinii-infected but not in the mock-infected lanes of the mRNA differential display gel. Three of these bands (Fig. 1), designated A4II, A6I, and A8I, were selected for further study. To identify the genes represented by the differentially displayed PCR products, the DNA was recovered from the gel, re-amplified, cloned, and sequenced. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) was used to identify the sequences thus obtained. The A4II product was determined to be a 234-bp DNA fragment with sequence approximately 60% homologous to nucleotides 134 - 234 of the yeast mitochondrial ori 1 sequence (gb|K02488|YSCMTORIA). This product was not further investigated since it is not a human or rat gene. The A6I product was found to be a 332-bp fragment with sequence identical to nucleotides 177 - 508 of the rat ribosomal protein S19 gene (emb|X51707|RRRPS19). The 287-bp A8I product was 100 % identical to nucleotides 3421 - 3707 of the rat mitochondrial ATPase 6 gene (gb|J01435|RATMTCYOS). Since we sought to detect genes that were up-regulated in the human host cell line, HEL 299, in response to P. carinii infection, it was surprising that none of the three selected PCR product bands were of human origin.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6075</offset><text>To verify the expression pattern seen in the mRNA differential display, the cloned A6I and A8I fragments were used to probe Northern blots of RNAs derived from non-infected and P. carinii-infected rat lungs. The A6I probe reacted with a 0.8-kb RNA band, but the intensities of the RNA bands of samples from mock- and P. carinii-infected rat lungs were approximately the same. Therefore, the A6I product band was not further studied. The A8I probe reacted with an RNA band of approximately 0.7 kb (Fig. 2), which is the size of the rat ATPase 6 mRNA. Both P. carinii-infected and mock-infected RNA samples showed the 0.7-kb band. The intensity of the band of the RNA sample from P. carinii-infected rat lung is approximately 4 times stronger than that of the sample from non-infected rat lungs based on densitometric analysis of the autoradiogram. The band intensities of the same blot probed with a fragment of the 18S rRNA gene were used as an internal control for variations in the amount of RNA loaded on the blot (Fig. 2). These results indicate that non-infected rat lungs have a basal level of ATPase 6 gene expression and that this expression is increased in P. carinii-infected lungs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7268</offset><text>To verify over-expression of the ATPase 6 gene in rat lung tissue, in situ hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes was performed. Slides, each of which contained lung tissue sections of both dexamethasone-immunosuppressed non-infected (NRL) and P. carinii-infected (PcIRL) rats, were probed with sense and anti-sense riboprobes of the ATPase 6 gene. The sections reacted with the sense probe served as a control for non-specific background signal. The sections reacted with the anti-sense probe were expected to show a dark blue precipitate in cells as an indication of ATPase 6 gene expression. A dark blue precipitate was not seen in NRL and PcIRL sections reacted with the sense riboprobe (Fig. 3, ATPase 6 probe, panels NRL, S and PcIRL, S) but was seen in 2 - 3 cells per alveolus in the NRL sections reacted with the anti-sense riboprobe (Fig. 3, ATPase 6 probe, NRL, AS). Large alveolar macrophages with blue precipitates were also seen in some of the alveolar spaces. In addition, some of the epithelial cells of the very distal parts of the respiratory tree also showed blue precipitate (Data not shown). In sections of PcIRL reacted with the anti-sense riboprobe, hybridization signal was seen in many more cells per alveolus when compared to those of NRL. Some alveoli were packed with foamy exudate indicative of a heavy P. carinii infection. Most of the cells in the septal areas around these alveoli reacted with the probe (Fig. 3, ATPase 6 probe, PcIRL, AS), but there was no reaction with the probe in consolidated alveolar spaces, indicating that the probe did not react with P. carinii organisms.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8893</offset><text>Cells in the apical areas of the alveoli are usually type II pneumocytes, and the non-ciliated cuboidal epithelial cells in the very distal parts of the respiratory tree are usually Clara cells.

To confirm this possibility, in situ hybridization with a probe specific for type II pneumocytes and Clara cells was performed. This probe was a 202-bp fragment of a portion of the rat surfactant protein-B (SP-B) gene (emb|X14778|RNSPB) that is expressed only in type II pneumocytes and Clara cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9591</offset><text>As seen in Fig. 3 (SPB probe, S), tissue sections (NRL or PcIRL) reacted with the SP-B sense probe showed no hybridization signal.

In PcIRL sections reacted with the anti-sense probe, more cells than in the NRL sections in apical areas of alveoli had blue precipitate, indicating SP-B expression (Fig. 3, SPB probe, PcIRL, AS).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10185</offset><text>To confirm that ATPase 6-expressing cells are type II pneumocytes and Clara cells, double-probe fluorescent in situ hybridization was performed. Sections of NRL and PcIRL tissues were hybridized simultaneously with fluorescein-labeled SP-B and digoxigenin-labeled ATPase 6 riboprobes. Hybridized fluorescein-labeled SP-B or digoxigenin-labeled ATPase 6 riboprobes were visualized as green or red fluorescence, respectively, using the appropriate filter on a fluorescent microscope. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI and emitted a blue fluorescence under the appropriate filter. Sections of NRL and PcIRL hybridized with the sense probes for both ATPase 6 and SP-B showed little red or green fluorescence (Fig. 4, G and H). These sections exhibited predominately host cell nuclei that appeared as large blue elliptical rings or spherical masses, whereas P. carinii nuclei appeared as small blue, punctate clusters in the alveolar spaces (Fig. 4H). Composite images of NRL (Fig. 4A) and PcIRL (Fig. 4B) sections hybridized with the anti-sense riboprobe for both ATPase 6 and SP-B exhibited large blue nuclei surrounded by yellow fluorescence in the cytoplasm. This yellow fluorescence was due to complementation between red and green signals derived from anti-sense ATPase 6 (red signal) and SP-B (green signal) probes that hybridized with RNAs in the same cells. Panels 4, C and D; and E and F are images of 4A and 4B, respectively, split into individual green (SP-B) and red (ATPase 6) channels. With very rare exceptions, cells that expressed the ATPase 6 gene also expressed the SP-B gene. In addition, no hybridization signal (red or green) was seen in areas that had clusters of P. carinii organisms. These results strongly indicate that type II pneumocytes and Clara cells are the sources of ATPase 6 over-expression during P. carinii infection.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>12037</offset><text>Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12048</offset><text>The technique of mRNA differential display has been used to detect differences in gene expression between different types of cells, during cell transformation, and in various stages of disease development. In this study, we used it to detect genes that are over-expressed in P. carinii-infected cells. Homogenates of lungs from non-infected and P. carinii-infected rats were used to inoculate a human cell line, the HEL cell line, to determine whether P. carinii would up-regulate or induce gene expression in infected HEL cells. Unexpectedly, we detected and identified the mitochondrial ATPase 6 gene, which appears to be over-expressed in response to P. carinii infection as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2) and in situ hybridization (Figs. 3 and 4) in rat lungs. The possibility that the observed increase in hybridization signal to the rat ATPase 6 probe was due to crossover contamination by yeast- or P.carinii-derived ATPase 6 mRNA is remote because the mitochondrial ATPase 6 gene of yeast shares only 16 % sequence identity with that of rat. Furthermore, there was no indication of ATPase 6 signal originating from yeast or P. carinii organisms in the in situ experiments that were performed (Figs. 3 and 4).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13282</offset><text>ATPase 6 is a component of the F0F1 ATP synthase complex, which converts the energy stored in the form of the proton motive force to chemical energy in the form of ATP. This complex is composed of 2 major domains, F1 and F0. F1 is the catalytic portion of the enzyme. It lies on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane and is composed of 6 subunits of α3β3γδε and an ATPase inhibitor protein. F0 is the integral membrane domain of the complex and functions as a proton channel in ATP synthesis. F0 has 2 domains: the stalk-like domain and the integral membrane domain. The stalk-like domain of F0 is composed of two proteins, OSCP (oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein) and F6. OSCP is found as a dimer in each F0 sector. It interacts with the F1 sector and is required for H+ translocation. The integral membrane domain is composed of 3 main proteins: subunits 6, A6L, and 9. Subunit 6 is the product of the ATPase 6 gene. Little is known about the structure and function of the subunit 6 protein except that it is an integral membrane protein that interacts with the OSCP subunit and may be involved in energy coupling to the F1 sector. The A6L subunit is also an integral membrane protein associated with the F0 sector. There are approximately 10 copies of subunit 9 involved in forming the proton channel.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14630</offset><text>Except for ATPase 6 and A6L, which are encoded by the mitochondrial genome, all of the subunits of the F0F1 ATP synthase complex are encoded by nuclear genes. It is not clear how expression of each of the protein subunits is regulated or how the complexes are assembled on the mitochondrial inner membrane. It has been shown that triiodothyronine (T3) increases the transcription of the ATPase 9 gene of the F0 complex but has no effect on the transcription of the β subunit of the F1 sector. This result suggests that the two sectors of the complex are not necessarily coordinately expressed.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15227</offset><text>As mentioned above, the cells that expressed the ATPase 6 gene were found to be located at the apical areas of the alveoli and in the epithelium of the very distal parts of the respiratory tree. The apical areas are where type II pneumocytes are located, and the very distal parts of the respiratory tree are where Clara cells are located. Cells in these locations were also found to react with the SP-B probe. Since the SP-B gene is known to be expressed only in type II pneumocytes and Clara cells, the results suggest that these two types of cells are over-expressing the ATPase 6 gene in response to P. carinii infection.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15853</offset><text>The fact that the rat mitochondrial ATPase 6 gene was isolated from HEL cells inoculated with homogenate of P. carinii-infected rat lungs suggests that rat cells were present in the inoculum and survived in culture. This possibility is consistent with the nature of type II pneumocytes, as they are known to be long-lived in culture. In this study, the HEL cells were incubated with the inoculum for 5 days before the cultures were processed for RNA isolation. This 5-day incubation was to allow sufficient time for P. carinii organisms to interact with the feeder layer (HEL cells) and for apoptosis of the short-lived rat-derived cells that were present in the inoculum. It is likely that type II pneumocytes survived for the entire 5-day period of incubation. It is also likely that some of the HEL cells died in the incubation period and that differentially expressed HEL RNAs were missed. Since no human genes were found to be over-expressed by the mRNA differential display performed in this study, the effects of P. carinii infection in gene expression in HEL cells or in human lungs remain to be investigated.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16971</offset><text>The significance of over-expression of the mitochondrial ATPase 6 gene in P. carinii-infected lung is unknown. Since type II pneumocytes transform into type I pneumocytes in response to lung injury, it is possible that this process requires a higher amount of ATP. To satisfy this need, these cells may increase the expression of the genes of the F0F1 ATP synthase complex. This hypothesis implies that the expression of all or most of the genes encoding various components of the ATP synthase complex would be up-regulated in response to P. carinii infection. It is also possible that ATPase 6 plays a role in other functions that also respond to P. carinii infection. If this were the case, genes of other components of the ATP synthase would not necessarily be up-regulated together with the ATPase 6 gene. All of these possibilities remain to be studied. It also remains to be determined whether over-expression of the ATPase 6 gene is specific for P. carinii infection. It is conceivable that over-expression of the ATPase 6 gene can be a diagnostic marker if it is unique to P. carinii infection. Studies are underway to explore these possibilities.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>18127</offset><text>Conclusions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18139</offset><text>The technique of mRNA differential display was used to detect genes that have an altered expression in Pneumocystis carinii-infected hosts.

Therefore, band A4II was found in the A-anchored primer (H-T11-A) reaction with the AP4 arbitrary primer and was the second differentially displayed band in that lane. Differentially displayed bands were isolated and reamplified with the same primer pair as that used to produce the isolated differential display band. The amplified DNA was cloned into the TA cloning vector pCRII (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and then sequenced by the Sanger method using the Sequenase (Amersham Life Science, Cleveland, OH) protocol as described previously.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>25561</offset><text>Cloning of a rat surfactant protein B gene fragment</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25613</offset><text>A 202-bp portion corresponding to nucleotides 441 to 643 of the rat surfactant protein B gene (emb|X14778|RNSPB) was amplified from rat lung RNA by RT-PCR and then cloned as follows. Two hundred ng of rat lung total RNA was added to a reaction which contained 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KC1, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, 1 mM of each dNTP, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 2.9 U RNasin, 20 pmoles of primer SP-BR (5'-GAATCACAGCTTGGACCCGC-3'), and 16 U MMLV reverse transcriptase. This RT reaction was incubated at 42°C for 60 minutes. The RT reaction products were mixed with 20 pmoles of primer SP-BF (5'-GACTAAGCCAGAGCAGAAGC-3') and 2 U of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase and then subjected to PCR which included 7 minutes at 94°C followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 minute, 62°C for one minute, and 72°C for 1.5 minutes. The resulting RT-PCR product was cloned into TA vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Two clones, pCR21/4SP-B and pCR22/lSP-B, which had the SP-B gene fragment in opposite orientations, were selected.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>26632</offset><text>Generation and preparation of riboprobes</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26673</offset><text>The ATPase 6 clones were used as templates in PCRs with primer pairs RATPase6F (5'-ACCCCCATCTCACTAATTCC-3') and RATPase6R (5'-AGTACTAGGGTAGCTCCTCC-3') to generate a 145 bp fragment to make ATPase 6 riboprobes. Similarly, a 202 bp fragment was amplified from pCR21/4SP-b with primers SP-BF and SP-BR (see above) to produce SP-B riboprobes. Each PCR product was ligated to adapters that contained an SP6 promoter sequence (SP6 adapter) in one reaction or to adapters with a T7 promoter sequence (T7 adapter) in another reaction according to the Lig'nScribe™ (Ambion, Austin, TX) protocol. The ligation products were amplified with an adapter-specific primer and either the probe-specific forward primer RATPase6F or SP-BF (for the T7 adapter ligation) or the probe-specific reverse primer RATPase6R or SP-BR (for the SP6 adapter ligation). Four PCR products were thus generated: RATPase6F-T7 adapter, SP6 adapter-RATPase6R, SP-BF-T7 adapter, and SP6 adapter-SP-BR.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27638</offset><text>The RATPase6F-T7 adapter and SP-BF-T7 adapter PCR products were used as templates for in vitro transcription to produce antisense riboprobes, and the SP6 adapter-RATPase6R or SP6 adapter-SP-BR PCR PCR products were used to make sense probes.
