A major component is the  trabecular meshwork, consisting of extracellular matrix organized into a  network of beams, covered in trabecular endothelial cells. Between the beams,  channels lead to Schlemm's canal for the drainage of aqueous humor from the eye  into the blood stream. Abnormal development of the iridocorneal angle that  interferes with ocular fluid drainage can lead to glaucoma in humans. Little is  known about the precise mechanisms underlying angle development. There are two  main hypotheses. The first proposes that morphogenesis involves mainly cell  differentiation, matrix deposition and assembly of the originally continuous  mesenchymal mass into beams, channels and Schlemm's canal. The second, based  primarily on rat studies, proposes that cell death and macrophages play an  important role in forming channels and beams. Mice provide a potentially useful  model to understand the origin and development of angle structures and how  defective development leads to glaucoma. Few studies have assessed the normal  structure and development of the mouse angle. We used light and electron  microscopy and a cell death assay to define the sequence of events underlying  formation of the angle structures in mice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract_title_1</infon><offset>1459</offset><text>Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1467</offset><text>The mouse angle structures and developmental sequence are similar to those  in humans.

The anterior segment of the eye is filled  with a clear fluid known as the aqueous humor or aqueous. Maintenance of IOP is  dependent on a balance between aqueous formation and aqueous outflow. The  primary source of aqueous is blood flowing through the arteries of the ciliary  body. The aqueous is secreted by the ciliary body  into the posterior chamber between the iris and lens. It then flows into the  anterior chamber, the space between the cornea and iris, before draining from  the eye at the iridocorneal junction. The  iridocorneal junction is located in a region known as the iridocorneal angle  because of the aqueous filled angular recess between the iris root and cornea.  One drainage route consists of a trabecular meshwork (TM) of connective tissue  covered by endothelial like trabecular cells and a Schlemm's canal (SC). The  aqueous percolates through channels or intertrabecular spaces in the TM before  entering SC. The fluid collected by SC drains into aqueous veins that connect  to the canal. This route is generally accepted to be the major drainage pathway  for the aqueous. Egress via the loose connective  tissue meshwork and blood vessels of the uvea (choroid, iris and ciliary body)  and the outer wall of the eye (sclera) also contributes to aqueous drainage  . Primary access of aqueous  to the uveoscleral route is likely deep in the angle recess at the iridocorneal  junction. The resistance to aqueous flow presented by the tissues of the TM,  SC, and likely uvea and sclera are important determinants of the rate of  aqueous outflow and IOP.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3558</offset><text>The molecular mechanisms responsible for normal or abnormal development of  the iridocorneal angle, its structures, and increased resistance to aqueous  drainage in glaucoma are not well defined. Cell migration, proliferation, and  differentiation are important for the development of this ocular region. Cells  of the periocular mesenchyme migrate into the developing eye and differentiate  into various anterior segment structures including components of the ciliary  body, the TM, iris stroma, corneal endothelium and corneal stroma. The origin  of the periocular mesenchyme was originally suggested to be the paraxial  mesoderm. Later fate mapping studies using  quail-chick chimeras show extensive cranial neural crest contribution to this  tissue. Based on these avian  studies, the mammalian periocular mesenchyme is generally accepted as neural  crest derived. Recent cell  grafting and cell labeling studies of craniofacial morphogenesis in mouse  embryos confirm a neural crest derivation of the mammalian periocular  mesenchyme. Additionally, however, they demonstrate  the presence of cranial paraxial mesoderm-derived cells in this tissue. Thus,  aberrations of both neural crest and mesoderm cell migration or differentiation  may contribute to anterior segment dysgenesis and glaucoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4859</offset><text>After the migrating mesenchymal cells reach the anterior margin of the  developing optic cup they must form the tissues of the iridocorneal angle. The  iridocorneal angle is initially occupied by a densely packed mass of  mesenchymal cells. As TM development proceeds the cellular mass differentiates,  organizes and develops channels to produce the mature meshwork. The developing  TM and iris separate forming the deep angle recess through which the aqueous  passes to access the TM. The mature meshwork consists of trabecular beams  separated by intertrabecular spaces through which the aqueous percolates. The  trabecular beams are covered on both surfaces by endothelial-like trabecular  cells and the cores of the beams are composed of extracellular matrix  components such as collagen and elastic tissue.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5671</offset><text>How the complex TM develops and how spaces form in the initially continuous  cellular tissue is not clear. Several theories have attempted to explain the  differentiation and morphogenesis of the mesenchyme that forms the tissues of  the iridocorneal angle (see [ , ,]). Some of these theories propose atrophy or  resorption of the mesenchyme as development progresses to create the structures  and spaces important for aqueous drainage while others propose a reorganization  of cells with no cell death or atrophy. Whether cell death or atrophy occurs  during TM and iridocorneal angle development remains controversial. Cell death  was prominent in rat, but not in monkey, human or dog eyes. It is not clear if different mechanisms  are important in rodents as compared to these other species, if there is  something unusual about the studied rat strain, or if cell death occurs in the  other species but was not detected due to inadequate tissue sampling or the  stages analyzed.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6654</offset><text>The mouse represents an important experimental model for understanding  mammalian development and diseases caused by its abnormalities. In studied  mammalian species, iridocorneal angle development is incomplete at birth.  Although various studies have characterized in detail the prenatal development  of the mouse eye there is very little published about the normal structure or  postnatal development of the mouse iridocorneal angle [ , ,]. The aims of this work  were to determine the developmental profile of the mouse iridocorneal angle to  its mature form and to assess the role of cell death in modeling the angle  recess and TM. We present a light and electron microscopic (EM) evaluation of  iridocorneal angle development in staged embryos and through eight postnatal  weeks, when the angle structures have reached full maturity. The mouse and  human TM and SC have similar structures, and the developmental progression is  similar except for the accelerated time frame in mice. Extensive use of light  microscopy, EM and a cell death assay (on sections spanning complete eyes)  failed to identify cell death at all tested ages in various mouse strains.  These results substantiate models of iridocorneal angle mesenchymal  differentiation and modeling that involve organization of cellular and  extracellular matrix components without cell death or atrophy, and they suggest  a conservation of developmental mechanisms between mice and non-rodent  mammals.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>8123</offset><text>Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8131</offset><text>The following descriptions reflect the most common situation at a specific  time as determined from the analysis of multiple animals and sections of  different locations around the eyes.

Due to these previous reports, we will focus on the formation of the  iridocorneal angle structures (see figure 2A for  location) with brief mention of the adjacent iris and cornea. Invagination of  the optic vesicle to form the optic cup occurs around E10, as the lens vesicle  is developing. Shortly after the stalk of the lens  vesicle disappears at E10.5, a few undifferentiated mesenchymal cells were  present adjacent to the anterior margin of the optic cup. These were more  prominent by E11.5 and were associated with blood vessels (Figure 2B) that become the source of the anterior vascular tunic of  the lens as well as contributing to the future vascular supply of the iris and  ciliary body. At this time, progenitor cells of the corneal stroma had migrated  into the developing cornea (not shown). By E14.5, the anterior margin of the  optic cup that ultimately forms the iris and ciliary body has started to  advance indicating that the anterior uvea and iridocorneal angle were starting  to form. The mesenchyme in the developing iridocorneal angle (angle mesenchyme)  had produced a loosely arranged cluster of cells that was several cells thick  and extended from the anterior edge of the optic cup to the anterior  termination of the retina. These cells were characterized by plump oval nuclei  with multiple nucleoli. There was no clear division between the mesenchyme of  the posterior corneal surface and the angle mesenchyme because the cells  remained undifferentiated (Figure 2C). By E16.5 the  anterior margin of the optic cup had extended more anteriorly but no obvious  differentiation into the iris and ciliary body had occurred. The angle  mesenchyme was more densely packed and continuous with the mesenchyme extending  onto the primitive iris that will become the iris stroma (Figure  2D). There was a clear separation between the developing iris and  cornea, the first appearance of the iridocorneal angle recess (Figure 2D). There were no obvious differences between E16.5 and E18.5  except that the ciliary body had started to form as previously reported.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>14671</offset><text>Postnatal development</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14693</offset><text>At birth (P0, 19.5 dpc), the angle mesenchyme was even more densely packed  and the cells and their nuclei were more elongated and less rounded than at  earlier stages (Figure 2E). The iris was more  differentiated as evidenced by the fact that some of the cells destined to form  the stroma had started to synthesize pigment and were, therefore,  distinguishable from those of the future TM.

These cells were less  densely packed than at earlier stages (Figure 2G).  Although not definitively identified in our P8 sections, at some locations  there appeared to be small vascular channels present near the developing TM.  The ciliary processes and iris had an apparently mature structure by P10. By  this age, the anterior cells of the future TM had begun to separate, although  the posterior cells remained closely packed (Figure 2H).  The first clear indications of Schlemm's canal next to the developing TM were  observed on P10 as multiple small endothelial-lined channels located in the  inner sclera over the posterior aspect of the ciliary body, although this was  best seen using transmission EM (see below). The presence or absence of these  endothelial channels at this location varied with ocular region. The anterior  TM had started to separate focally from the iris at P10, and this was more  extensive at P12. The angle mesenchyme had further developed into beam like  structures by P12 and, though small, more open spaces were apparent (Figure  2I). At P12 either endothelial-lined vessels or a more  mature SC were present in most sections.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16992</offset><text>By P14, further spaces had opened in the angle, especially anteriorly, and  for the first time there was a consistent separation between the anterior TM  and iris root, forming the deep angle recess (Figure 3A).  At this age, a SC that extended from the posterior end of the ciliary body to a  point slightly posterior to the end of Descemet's membrane was consistently  observed in all ocular regions. Additionally, the separation of the iris away  from the TM gave the appearance that SC and TM moved anteriorly. Giant vacuoles  (structures important for aqueous movement from the TM to canal lumen) were  clearly observed indicating that SC was functional at P14 (Figure 3A). By three weeks of age, SC had extended forward to the  posterior termination of Descemet's membrane and large open spaces were present  in the anterior TM. Fewer spaces were evident in the posterior TM (Figure 3B). Over the next few weeks, the spaces between the trabecular  beams gradually became more open and extended further into the posterior TM.  Depending on the mouse and ocular location, the iridocorneal angle and its  structures typically reached their mature state by P35 to P42 (compare Figure  3C and 3D). In the mature state, the  intertrabecular spaces were always most prominent in the anterior aspect of the  TM, and less so posteriorly (Figure 3C and  3D).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>18347</offset><text>Other strains</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18361</offset><text>The postnatal developmental stages and time frame described above for B6  mice is essentially the same as that we observed for the A.BY/SnJ strain (not  shown).

Similar review of many sections  by EM failed to demonstrate any cells that had necrotic or apoptotic  morphology. This was true for multiple mouse strains (see Methods). It is  probable that all normal cell death during development utilizes pathways of  programmed cell death (PCD). To further investigate  if cell death occurred in the developing iridocorneal angle, we used a  fluorescent double labeling assay that identifies fragmented DNA using  fluorescently labeled dUTP and detects chromatin condensation by binding of the  dye YOYO-1. Cells were identified as apoptotic only when they were doubly  labeled (Figure 6). This assay is more sensitive than  light microscopy and allows more widespread testing than EM. As shown above, TM  channel formation has started at P10 and is mostly complete around P18 to P20,  with subtle changes extending to P35 to P42. Our assay investigated tissues  that spanned most of this period (see Methods), including four time points in  the critical period surrounding P10 to P18 (P10, P12, P14 and P18). The  majority of the angle was assessed by analyzing many sections that were  obtained at 20 μm intervals throughout the eye. During differentiation  from the trabecular anlage to a mature state, only 2 doubly labeled cells were  identified in the angles of approximately 600 analyzed sections or  approximately 120,000 analyzed TM and SC cells. One of these positive cells was  located in the lumen of Schlemm's canal and was likely a blood cell. No  apoptotic cells were detected in the ciliary body and iris. In contrast,  apoptotic retinal ganglion cells (Figure 6) were  frequently identified (often 2 or more apoptotic cells in a section) during the  established period of developmental ganglion cell death (assessed between P10  and P21) and less abundantly afterwards.

Although  there is evidence for a role of most of these processes in iridocorneal angle  development and intertrabecular space opening (see [ ]), the role of cell death or atrophy is controversial.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30156</offset><text>In Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, dying cells were readily identified from P5 to  P100 (average of 10 to 20 dying cells per section) and less abundantly at older  adult ages (1 to 3 per section at P200). This time  frame encompasses the period of mesenchymal differentiation and channel  formation in the rat angle (P5 to P60). Due to this and the fact that dying  cells were identified in the TM, iris, iris root and ciliary body, it was  proposed that cell death may serve to open the deep angle recess and to create  spaces in the TM and uveoscleral outflow routes. The dying cells were  frequently associated with macrophages. An established function of macrophages  is the engulfment of cellular debris. Macrophages also can elicit cell death in  normal development (see). In the developing eye,  macrophages are required to induce death of vascular endothelial cells during  programmed capillary regression. Disruption of macrophage function prevents  endothelial cell death and results in abnormal persistence of the capillary  networks known as the pupillary membrane and hyaloid vasculature. Together, these observations  suggest that macrophage induced cell death may be important in angle  morphogenesis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31367</offset><text>By contrast to the rat study, trabecular cell death was not observed or was  rare in the developing human, monkey and dog TM [,   , ], even though small numbers of macrophages were  present in some of these studies.

Macrophages were reported in the developing mouse (B6) anterior  chamber and a model of TM development including cell death was proposed, but no  cell death was recorded. The reason for these  differing results is still unclear, and may reflect factors such as the age of  tissue sampled or the amount of tissue available for study.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>32057</offset><text>No evidence for cell death during mouse angle development</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32115</offset><text>We report here an extensive study of mouse eyes. Light microscopy failed to  detect cell death in the developing TM of B6 and A.BY/SnJ mice. Dying cells  were not detected in the angle of mice of an additional 5 inbred strains and 3  mixed genetic backgrounds at ages up to P63. No cells with the characteristic  morphologic changes of apoptosis or necrosis were observed by EM in mice of strain B6, or of 5  other inbred strains and 2 mixed genetic backgrounds at ages up to P63.  Similarly, only 2 apoptotic cells were detected in the developing SC, TM, iris  and ciliary body of B6 eyes using a cell death assay on sections collected  throughout entire eyes. In contrast, apoptotic cells were frequently identified  in the developing retinas on the same sections. Importantly, the great majority  of TM channel formation occurs during an 8 to 10 day period surrounding P10 to  P18. Our EM and fluorescent PCD assays included three (P10, P14 and P18) and  four (P10, P12, P14 and P18) time points respectively during this critical  period. Although rare cases of cell death may be missed, the absence of cell  death in approximately 600 analyzed sections provides no evidence for a role of  cell death in angle morphogenesis. Finally, development of the angle in  Fas and Fasl null mice was normal indicating this system of cell  death regulators that can kill TM cells is not  required for TM channel formation. Based on these observations, we conclude  that neither apoptosis nor necrosis are important mechanisms in development of  the mouse TM and iridocorneal angle. Our data, together with the rare  occurrence of cell death in studies of various mammalian species including  humans, suggests that this is true for mammals in general.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>33858</offset><text>Possible explanations for conflicting results between various  studies</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33929</offset><text>The absence of macrophages in the developing TM of mice in the current study  is in conflict to a previous study.

The abundance of TM macrophages was not reported but the  statement that they were observed in &quot;favorable sections&quot; suggests that they  were not common. Macrophage mediated regression of the pupillary membrane  occurs between P4 and P10 in mice. In the current investigation, we observed macrophages in the  anterior chamber between the iris and cornea, and associated with the pupillary  membrane between P6 and P10. Thus, we suggest that the macrophages previously  reported in TM of mice (and possibly some other species) were involved in the  process of pupillary membrane regression and were sometimes deposited in the TM  but were not significant for TM development.

This report disagrees with our findings in mice and warrants further  discussion. In this rat strain, conspicuous numbers of macrophages were noted  associated with dying cells in the iris, ciliary body and TM. Given the  similarities in developmental stages between both B6 and A.BY/SnJ mouse strains  and humans, and the similar timing and progression of angle development in mice  and rats, it seems unlikely that mechanisms of angle morphogenesis would differ  between mice and rats. It is, therefore, difficult to reconcile the frequent  cell death in the developing and adult iridocorneal angle of an SD rat strain  with the absence of cell death in multiple mouse strains in the current study.  Although structural features and not morphogenesis were the focus of other rat  studies, cell death was not reported in an EM analysis of the adult TM of Swiss  albino rats, or of the adult angle of an unspecified strain of pigmented lab  rats. These findings  suggest that the SD rat strain may have atypical or excessive intraocular  macrophage recruitment, formation, stimulation or persistence that may explain  the macrophage abundance and cell death. Spontaneous axonal regeneration was  recently reported in the transected optic nerve of adult SD rats. This was unexpected because, in contrast to peripheral  nerves, axons of the adult, mammalian central nervous system typically fail to  regenerate following injury. Regeneration is a complex and poorly understood  process in which macrophages are known to be important. Addition of  appropriately stimulated macrophages can induce a peripheral nerve-like  regenerative response in the damaged rat optic nerve [ ,]. Although the spontaneous  axonal regeneration in SD rats is consistent with atypical macrophage activity,  further experiments are needed to test this.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>36858</offset><text>Conclusions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>36870</offset><text>Our results support a model of mesenchymal differentiation and iridocorneal  angle development that involves reorganization of cellular and extracellular  matrix components without cell death or atrophy. The use of genetically  different mouse strains indicates that the absence of cell death is typical in  mice and not unique to an individual strain. The lack of cell death, similar  developmental profile, and similarities in mature angle structure in both  humans and mice suggests a conservation of general developmental mechanisms  between mice and non-rodent mammals. For general anterior segment development,  this is supported by the observations that genetic deficiency of transcription  factors such as PAX6, PITX2, FOXC1, and LMX1B that are expressed in the  periocular mesenchyme results in anterior segment dysgenesis in both humans and  mice. In general, however, previous mouse studies have not examined the  effects of mutations on the TM and SC. This is partly due to limited  documentation of the sequence of events underlying iridocorneal angle  development and limited documentation of the mature angle structures in mice.  The current study provides important baseline information for mechanistic  studies of angle development in the existing mouse models of anterior segment  dysgenesis. Additionally, it will facilitate experiments with mutant mice to  determine how newly identified genes function in angle development and how the  pathways in which they participate overlap or interact with each other. These  experiments will enhance understanding of the developmental processes involved  in anterior segment formation, and glaucomas associated with anterior segment  dysgenesis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>38577</offset><text>Materials and Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>38599</offset><text>All experiments were performed in compliance with the ARVO statement for use  of animals in vision research.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>38708</offset><text>Light microscopy</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>38725</offset><text>At least three mice C57BL/6J (B6) were evaluated for each postnatal time  period: newborn, P2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, and P56.

Iridocorneal  angle development is somewhat variable both temporally and spatially within a  single eye and between eyes. This necessitated careful scanning of all  sections. The eyes of other strains were processed identically, except that 30  to 40 sections through the pupil and optic nerve were typically collected and  analyzed. This also was true for some of the adult eyes from B6 mice that were  P60 or older.
