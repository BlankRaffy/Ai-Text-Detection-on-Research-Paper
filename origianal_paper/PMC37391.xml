Among the best studied examples of cullin/RING enzymes are the so-called SCF complexes. SCF complexes share homologues of the core components cullin 1 (CUL1), SKP1, and the RING domain protein HRT1/RBX1/ROC1, which associate with different F-box proteins and ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. F-box proteins specifically bind substrates, following their phosphorylation in response to activation of various signaling pathways. Although substrate phosphorylation is one major determinant of SCF-mediated ubiquitylation, covalent modification of the CUL1 subunit through attachment of the ubiquitin-related peptide NEDD8 also regulates SCF activity. NEDD8 modification stimulates SCF-dependent substrate ubiquitylation in vitro, and mutant CUL1 resistant to NEDD8 modification is defective in vivo. In addition, fission yeast mutants deficient in the enzymes that attach Ned8p, or in the ned8 gene itself, are inviable.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2661</offset><text>In addition to CUL1, the human genome contains at least five other cullins, CUL 2, 3, 4A, 4B, and 5. This diversity is partially recapitulated in S. pombe, which encodes pcu3 and pcu4, homologues of human CUL3 and CUL4, for which there are no direct correlates in budding yeast. All human cullins interact with HRT1/RBX1/ROC1, are modified by NEDD8, and have ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro. Similarly, the fission yeast cullins Pcu1p and Pcu4p are neddylated, and neddylation is critical for their function in vivo..</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3182</offset><text>While it is clear that neddylation affects the activity of cullin/RING complexes, mechanisms controlling this modification are just emerging. A recent study by Lyapina et al. uncovered a novel connection between the COP9/signalosome (CSN) and cullin neddylation. CSN is a highly conserved multiprotein complex consisting of eight subunits, which have been implicated in a wide variety of regulatory processes, including, cell cycle control, signal transduction, transcriptional activation, and plant photomorphogenesis. To date, no distinct biochemical activity has been identified that can reconcile this diversity in CSN functions. The eight CSN subunits show a one-to-one relationship to components of the 19S proteasome lid complex and, like pcu3 and pcu4, at least seven of the eight human subunits are conserved in fission yeast, but not in budding yeast..</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4045</offset><text>Lyapina et al. recently showed that disruption of S. pombe CSN subunit 1 (caa1/csn1) results in accumulation of Pcu1p in the neddylated state.

We have examined this question by determining the effect of disruption of several CSN subunits on Pcu3p neddylation, localization, and ubiquitin ligase activity.

Several findings indicate that the slower migrating form of Pcu3p arose from covalent modification with the ubiquitin-related protein Ned8p: First, overexpression of a fusion protein of Ned8p and glutathione transferase (GST-Ned8p) converted the faster, unmodified form of Pcu3p into a high molecular weight species that reacted with antibodies to GST (Fig. 1A). Second, replacing lysine 729, which is homologous to the conserved neddylation sites in other cullins, with arginine, completely abolished the slower migrating, modified form of Pcu3p (Fig. 1B). In contrast, mutation of a neighboring conserved lysine (residue 760) did not alter the mobility of Pcu3p. Thus, as with other S. pombe cullins, Pcu3p undergoes covalent modification by ubiquitin-like Ned8p at lysine 729.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1471-2091-2-7-1.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>5746</offset><text>Pcu3p is modified by Ned8p on lysine 729.

This shift in migration is due to Pcu3p neddylation as shown by overexpression of GST-Ned8p in csn1 mutants. This caused an additional supershift, converting a substantial portion of the slower migrating form into a GST-Ned8p modified species (Fig. 2B). Importantly, accumulation of neddylated Pcu3p was also apparent in strains deleted for csn3, csn4, and csn5 (Fig. 2A), three genes encoding other putative subunits of the S. pombe CSN, which co-fractionate with Csn1p upon size exclusion chromatography (see below, Fig. 4). However, unlike csn1 disruptants, which have a defect in S phase control resulting in slow growth and cell elongation, deletion of csn3, csn4, and csn5 genes did not cause cell elongation, S phase delay, or any other obvious growth defects (Fig. 2C, 2D, data not shown). This indicates that the described phenotype of csn1 mutants is unlikely to be a consequence of interference with Pcu3p activity. Pcu1p, another fission yeast cullin also accumulated in the neddylated form in all csn mutants (Fig. 2A), suggesting that CSN has a general role in the control of cullin neddylation in fission yeast. The accumulation of neddylated Pcu3p was prevented in all csn mutants by providing the missing CSN subunit on a plasmid (Fig. 3).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1471-2091-2-7-2.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F2</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>8456</offset><text>Neddylated Pcu3p accumulates in csn mutants.

Deletion of pcu1 and pcu3 results either in lethality or in severe growth retardation, respectively. The normal growth behavior of csn3, 4, and 5 mutants (Fig. 2C,2D), where both cullins seem constitutively neddylated, argues against a critical role for dynamic cycles of neddylation and deneddylation in cullin function in fission yeast. Consistent with this notion, the subcellular localization of Pcu3p and Pcu1p were unaffected by mutations in CSN (Fig. 5). Instead, neddylated Pcu3p and Pcu1p purified from csn mutant cell extract exhibit increased ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro (Fig. 6B). Thus, CSN may exert negative control on Pcu1p and Pcu3p by promoting their deneddylation. However, while mutation of csn5 caused a modest two-fold increase in the steady state fraction of neddylated Pcu3p (Fig. 2A), Pcu3p-associated ubiquitin ligase activity recovered from this mutant showed a much more dramatic increase (Fig. 6C). This suggests the possibility that CSN represses Pcu3p activity by other mechanisms, in addition to its control of neddylation. Further experiments are required to determine whether recombinant Csn5p or purified CSN complex can inhibit Pcu3p-associated ubiquitin ligase activity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20386</offset><text>Lyapina et al. recently provided evidence for a cullin deneddylating activity of CSN by demonstrating that a partially purified preparation of the pig CSN can deneddylate the fission yeast cullin Pcu1p in vitro. The results presented here eliminate the attractive hypothesis that the cysteine box in Csn5p, which is conserved in numerous deubiquitylating enzymes, harbors a critical activity for deneddylation (Fig. 3A). In addition, recombinant Csn5p failed to deneddylate Pcu1p and Pcu3p in vitro (unpublished observation). Our finding that hyperneddylated Pcu3p and Pcu1p accumulate in all csn mutants tested (Fig. 2A, and data not shown), also suggests that control of cullin neddylation results from cooperation of multiple CSN components rather than from the activity of a single catalytic subunit. The CSN complex may, for example, serve as a platform for recruitment of a separate deneddylating enzyme. A human NEDD8-processing isopeptidase has been described previously. The potential role of CSN as an organizing center for certain enzymatic activities may not be restricted to the control of cullin neddylation, as CSN was also shown to mediate phosphorylation of c-JUN, IkBa, and p53 by a tightly associated kinase(s).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21617</offset><text>So far, we were unable to obtain deneddylation of Pcu3p-13Myc in vitro by partially purified CSN preparations active in deneddylation of Pcu1p-13Myc (data not shown).

For example, binding by CSN could protect Pcu3p from the Ned8p-conjugating enzyme Ubc12p, thus maintaining a fraction of Pcu3p in a deneddylated state. As this shield is experimentally removed through deletion of CSN subunits, Pcu3p may accumulate in the neddylated state.

It is likely that some subunits have very specialized functions within the complex, while others are required for its broader activities such as control of cullin neddylation. On the other hand, we found that a sizable fraction of Csn5p is dissociated from the putative CSN holocomplex, but enriched in a 200 kDa assembly (Fig. 4B). It thus appears that part of the diversification of CSN function may arise from formation of smaller subcomplexes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>23102</offset><text>Conclusions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23114</offset><text>Our study reveals a general role of the S. pombe CSN complex in the control of cullin modification by Ned8p. Regardless of the exact mechanism, CSN may regulate the activity of multiple cullin ubiquitin ligases through counteracting their stimulatory Ned8p modification. Future studies will reveal whether some of the other described functions of CSN also involve post-translational modification of regulatory proteins by ubiquitin-like modifiers.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>23562</offset><text>Materials and methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>23584</offset><text>Plasmids and yeast strains</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23611</offset><text>S. pombe genes for UBCs and csn3, 4, and 5 were identified in the Sanger Centre S. pombe sequence database based on their homology to the respective human and budding yeast proteins.
