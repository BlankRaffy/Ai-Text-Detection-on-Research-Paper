0,"The paper introduces Motif, a method that links prior knowledge of a Large Language Model (LLM) with an agent for exploring complex environments.",Machine,0.5392
1,"Motif is based on using the preferences of the LLM to construct an intrinsic reward, which is used to train agents through reinforcement learning without requiring direct interaction with the environment.",Machine,0.996
2,"In the NetHack game, Motif achieves higher scores than methods that directly maximize the game score.",Human,0.0402
3,"By integrating Motif's intrinsic reward with that of the environment, the method significantly outperforms existing approaches, even in tasks without demonstrations.",Machine,0.7414
4,"Moreover, the behaviors generated by Motif are intuitive and aligned with humanity, with scalability appropriate to the size of the LLM and the information provided in the prompt.",Human,0.0794
