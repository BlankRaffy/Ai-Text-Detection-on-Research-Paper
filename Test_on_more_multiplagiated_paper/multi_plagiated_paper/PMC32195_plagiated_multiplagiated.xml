    <text>Measuring fertilization-induced calcium transients provides a novel experimental technique for studying C. elegans. Researchers can now examine thousands of mutants with fertilizer defects to determine whether there are any defects in the calcium transfer. The availability of forward genetic (gene knockout and RNAi) methods in Cryobacterium enables the testing of proteins believed to be involved in this crucial step of embryogenesis.</text>
