    <text>By examining this unique brain library in Drosophila we believe that the number of genes in this organism may be underestimated, and that this information complements the Droophile genome project by allowing for more complete annotation of the genomic sequence. This library is expected to provide valuable information about how basic brain functions work at the molecular level.</text>

    <text>In summary, Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that is often accompanied by synovitis of the joints, tendon sheaths, and bursae, but not always with systemic manifestations that do not involve the synospheric synagogue. These manifestation(s) are likely to be mediated by immunologic processes, while those of non-synonymous &quot;cells&quot; such as articular cell proliferation, neopathogen</text>

    <text>The focus of this investigation has been on minisatellites, which are shorter in length than 9 base-pairs, to avoid basic epidemiological significance and to facilitate the typing of alleles with agarose gel electrophoresis. Additionally, the database also contains simple sequence contingency loci that are of great interest for studying molecular pathogens. Bacterial species have a high prevalence of tandem repeats within their genomes and may benefit from increased data sharing.</text>
