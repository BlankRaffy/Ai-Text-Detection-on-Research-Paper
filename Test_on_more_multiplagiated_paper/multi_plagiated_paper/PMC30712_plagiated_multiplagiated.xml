    <text>Research on the characterization of protein complexes in skeletal muscle and heart, including information regarding genotype-phenotype relationships, will contribute to understanding the pathophysiology of human muscle diseases. We encourage other groups to test for the C598T DMN mutation in their human patient samples affected by muscular and cardiac diseases as well as generate desmuslin null animal models to further understand this important protein.</text>
