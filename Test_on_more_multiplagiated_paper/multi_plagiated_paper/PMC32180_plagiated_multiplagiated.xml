    <text>Our investigation reveals that the expression of AQP8 is indicative of normal colonic epithelial cells, which may indicate their involvement in fluid transport within the colon.</text>

    <text>Lastly, we demonstrate with various antibodies that both broad-spectrum BRCA1 and BRAC2 proteins are widely expressed in two types of non-embryogenic human tissues associated with the cell cycle: Brahmi1, Brca1 (B.rogena) and Brrgium2. Britain1 is expressed during growth and differentiation in the ovary, while Braz2 is present outside the site of spermatogenesis.</text>
