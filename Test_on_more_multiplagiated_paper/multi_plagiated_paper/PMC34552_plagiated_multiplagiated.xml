    <text>The genes studied for the disorder were all up-regulated by fracture in both age groups. This meant that the older rats did not heal quickly, and it may be due to the delayed union of their rats and the return of mRNA gene expression to baseline values.</text>

    <text>The genetic makeup of T1DM is highly variable, with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the short arm of chromosome 6 being the primary factor. There are also several approaches to pinpointing the exact location of an MHC component, including case-control studies, combined linkage and association searches, and systematic total genome searches.</text>

    <text>Our results show that eukaryotic homologues of bacterial signal transduction systems may be involved in serine/threonine kinases, and that the serous phosphorylation of DokA (dominusculum dominusera), homologous to dokTAS, is not dependent on histidine residue, which is essential for two-component systems, as demonstrated in vivo.</text>
