    <text>A gene encoding a putative four-transmembrane protein, BCMP1, has been detected in multiple mammalian species, which is regarded as supplementary information within this family. The gene is abundant in dog brain cells and is believed to cause X-linked mental retardation due to its chromosomal localization in humans.</text>

    <text>The use of model organisms and nematodes, such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the cylinder-shaped Caenorhabditis elegans, is common in their ability to detect and predict human gene function through extrapolation from ancestral genes.</text>

    <text>According to the current data, clonal expansion is a prevalent feature of the B-cell repertoire in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This process involves both resting memory B cells and activated B cell populations, which can be derived from within the bloodstream or synovial compartments, and may involve localized antigens located in the synoptics of joints.</text>
