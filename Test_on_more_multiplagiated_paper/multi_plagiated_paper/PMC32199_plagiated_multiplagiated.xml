    <text>The isolation of the asnO mutant demonstrates that fixT has a physiological regulation, which makes it unlikely that FixT serves as merely 'homeostatic' in S. meliloti (species hypotheses state that asanO may regulate the activity of its own protein, but our data suggest that this remains to be determined. An alternative function of asNO might be to pair nitrogen fixation gene expression in</text>

    <text>We have recently identified ethylene as a key regulator of plant growth, development and senescence. It is also involved in various stress responses such as activation of the calcium/protein phosphate receptor (PAP) and modulation or even death of cells caused by starvation.</text>

    <text>By comparing the sequences of Drosophila and C. elegans with human sequence information, we have identified 39 families of C2H2 ZNF genes with no known codons. Of these, only 17 have been defined so far, and we believe that there are 38 distinct groups of orthologous genes, each deriving from a single gene in the ancestor of these three organisms (the most recent example of this finding). Based on current metazoan phylogeny, corresponding members of each group represent smallest possible for all indicating that it was possible to form</text>
