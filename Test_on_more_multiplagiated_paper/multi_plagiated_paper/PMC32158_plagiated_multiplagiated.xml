    <text>Methanogenic Archaeans are not well-represented in the current 16S rRNA hybridization probes targeting their own species, and this lack of diversity means that new probe (and quantitative PCR assay) is needed to better characterize the distribution of newly identified methanogen clusters within rumen microbial communities.</text>

    <text>Abstract: Across many disciplines, standardised graphical representations of complex systems have been developed to facilitate communication, analysis and interpretation of knowledge. Although electronic circuit diagrams and architectural plans are widely used in biology, there is no universally agreed-upon standardized visual description language for describing functional systems, with much less ambiguity than traditional cartoon descriptions which often rely on print or online representation (via web 2.0) as a means of communicating and analyzing inter-domain and multidisciplinary biological problems.</text>

    <text>By examining only the differentiated or undifferentiated phenotype of the GL15 cell line, researchers can provide a reliable in vitro model for astrocytes, which can help to understand their essential physiological functions. Furthermore, the proposed model can also investigate the mechanism by which these cells interact with each other, particularly in relation to the human origin of this cell type.</text>
