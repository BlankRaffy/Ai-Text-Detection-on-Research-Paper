    <text>Our research indicates that resveratrol interacts with endothelial cells in vitro, leading to morphological and structural changes; the findings indicate that it may function as a cardioprotective substance.</text>

    <text>We have recently identified ethylene as a key regulator of plant growth, development and senescence. It is also involved in various stress responses such as activation of the calcium/protein phosphate receptor (PAP) and modulation or even death of cells caused by starvation.</text>

    <text>In summary, we found that cisapride reduces the risk of gastric contents aspiration in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients who are kept in a semirecumbent position. However, our findings suggest that conventional protective measures such as semicircumstance testing and yearly check-up of cigarette leaking during hand placement do not suffice to prevent gastrial contents from asping in this manner. Further studies are needed to determine whether this drug actually prevents ventilator-associated pneumonia, bronchitis or  asthma attacks.</text>
