    <text>We found no statistical significance in our findings despite having a moderate sample size. However, our study yielded results similar to the Taiwan study with only slight precision. The higher RR observed in different populations indicated that CYP2E1 is one of several NPC susceptibility genes and that the RsaI minus variant is just one mutation that affects phenotype.</text>

    <text>The results of Muskal and Kim suggested that the structure of a protein could be determined by its amino acid composition. Numerous attempts have been made to establish the structural class of any given protein based on this correlation. Bahar et al. and Chou have also discussed the physical mechanism behind this connection. In an updated review, Vapnik's Support Vector Machine was used to solve this problem. This paper uses data sets constructed by Zhou using SCOP. High rates of self-consistency and jackknife test confirmed that this feature.</text>
