    <text>The function and mechanism of HMG1, HMP2, and HPM2, two non histone proteins, have been the focus of various research for over a decade. These studies included investigating their homology with other proteins involved in development or differentiation, as well as their interaction with DNA and its role in circularization.</text>

    <text>Indications The distinct DNA structure called Form X which was previously observed but not yet identified by electrophoresis of DNA fragments containing a tract of the microsatellite polychloride (CA)  poly(acrylamide gelâ€“1) (Fig. 6) has now been discovered as 'a semicatenated DNA junction at the base of whose end does not appear to have originally contained structures of this kind, known as haematenanes', and that their preparation should allow study of their evolution and their possible function when introduced</text>
