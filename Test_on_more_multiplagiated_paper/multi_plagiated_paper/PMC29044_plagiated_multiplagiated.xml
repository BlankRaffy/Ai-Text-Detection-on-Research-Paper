    <text>The authors describe their knowledge of an unusual case of isolated vasculitis, confined to the left sylvian artery, caused by a cytomegalovirus that caused an auto-immune Guillain-Barrè syndrome (GBS). Despite receiving plasma exchanging and immune-modulating therapy, she developed acute cardiopulmonary failure and complete recovery was achieved with the help of IgM-enriched formula.</text>

    <text>The recognition of RNA-proteins is one of the most well-known by genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches. The primary and secondary structures of operator ARN are illustrated in Figure 1. This enables the formation of contacts with both subunits of coat protein. However, X-ray crystallography fails to identify specific amino acid-nucleotide contacts, leading to non-identical interactions between A-4 and A-10 that play a significant role in regulating repression of DNA.</text>

    <text>Heliox demonstrated an improvement in pulmonary mechanics in patients with severe methacholine-induced bronchospasm and a pediatric porcine model of independent lung mechanical ventilation, as measured by helioX at the same ventilator setting. The authors suggest that this type of therapy may be useful for children with small endotracheal tubes, high airway resistance, and delayed progress towards ventilated children.</text>
