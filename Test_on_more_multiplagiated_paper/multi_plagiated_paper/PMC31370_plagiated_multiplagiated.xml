    <infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon>
    <text>The results suggest that normal F9 cell differentiation requires the appropriately timed proteolysis of TBP and TAFII135, which is necessary for the regulation of genes by transactivators and other basal transcription factors.</text>

    <text>In this report, we describe how we have found RAR agonists with unique structural properties, thanks to the rapid discovery of new ones using a powerful virtual-ligand screening approach and avoiding the use of existing research strategies. The study presents one of the molecules as an example of these new pathways that could provide more favorable structural characteristics and potentially become valuable in cancer therapy.</text>
