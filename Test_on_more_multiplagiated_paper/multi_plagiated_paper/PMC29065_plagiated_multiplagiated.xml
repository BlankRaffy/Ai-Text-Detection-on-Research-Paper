    <text>The results suggest FuGENETM6-based techniques can be optimized to provide a practical means of gene transfer into rat (not shown in this article) hepatic stellate cells, and that the use of &quot;adenoviral-mediated&quot; transfer is also proving effective for gene delivery to these cellular targets.</text>

    <text>The mortality rate and mortality rates of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease have been widely recognized in developed countries, with the exception of France where high CHD rates are more common. However, a recent study by Siemann and Creasy suggests that wine consumption may be responsible for this phenomenon, as it can enhance the protective effects of certain naturally occurring elements.</text>

    <text>The use of mRNA differential display was employed to identify genes that have been altered in Pneumocystis carinii-infected hosts. The nucleotide sequence of one of the fragments displayed in the differentially determined expression corresponded to the gene encoding the rat mitochondrial ATPase 6, which is a subunit of F0F1-ATP synthases. Northern blot analysis of total RNA extracted from P. carINiI-treated rDNA lining the distal regions, as well as</text>
