    <text>Results of a phase-I/II randomized, masked, placebo-controlled trial of recombinant human interleukin-11 (rhIL-11) in the treatment of subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis</text>

    <text>During a 12-week trial, rhIL-11 was found to be safe and well-tolerated at various dosages and timings in patients with actively active RA. The only adverse event linked to the administration of the drug was an apparent reaction at the injection site.</text>

    <text>A variety of nutrition packages are routinely used for peri-operative care, including packages containing different nutrients. Knowledge of the stability of these mixtures is essential to avoid dangerous fusions of unstable compounds. The most important factors affecting the size of emulsion particles are pH, electrolyte concentration, and amino acid and lipid composition. Low zeta potential indicates reduced stability; six combinations were tested for particle size. All contained formulae were stable for 28 days at room temperature with or without MCT.</text>

    <text>We have developed an algorithm for mapping the positively selected mutations of viral quasispecies using sequence data. This method was used to map the positive selected variants (for example, those of influenza A HA, HIV-1 RT and HIV-120), as well as other obvious examples of selective mapping targeting viral subpopulations under different selective pressures: For example we used selection mapping of HIV isolates with different cellular tropisms; another application of this principle is possible for HIV breakthrough infections where we determined whether vaccines prevented the HIV quasivalent vaccine substances from a greater distance</text>
