    <text>The cohesin complex: sequence homologies, interaction networks and shared motifs</text>

    <infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon>
    <text>By combining genomic and proteomic data, we have formulated a comprehensive knowledge base to better understand the function of the cohesin complex. This has led to the identification of new homologs for SMC, the creation of fecundity motifs for shared DNA and protein coding, and the potential for Scc2 to act as kinase in response to experimental evidence.</text>

    <text>Abstract: Across many disciplines, standardised graphical representations of complex systems have been developed to facilitate communication, analysis and interpretation of knowledge. Although electronic circuit diagrams and architectural plans are widely used in biology, there is no universally agreed-upon standardized visual description language for describing functional systems, with much less ambiguity than traditional cartoon descriptions which often rely on print or online representation (via web 2.0) as a means of communicating and analyzing inter-domain and multidisciplinary biological problems.</text>

    <text>The significance of using functional and structural approaches to understand molecular interactions is highlighted by the fact that some contacts in the x-ray structure of the MS2 RNA-protein complex are significantly absent, while others remain significant. Figure 4 illustrates the important interactions at A-4 and A-10, including Val29 and Lys61.</text>
