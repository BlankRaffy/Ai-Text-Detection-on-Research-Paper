    <text>The occurrence of cervical cancer (CC) is highly prevalent in developing countries, and it is one of the most common malignancies among women. Epidemiological studies have indicated that human papillomaviruses (HPV) can initiate and cause endogenous genetic changes in this disease. Furthermore, some HPV proteins such as E6 and E7 interact with human tumor suppressor genes and disrupt the viral E2 gene, which can be used as a genetic marker to detect early precursors of these cancers. However, the DNA from the mouse or virus has been demonstrated</text>

    <text>In summary, we found that cisapride reduces the risk of gastric contents aspiration in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients who are kept in a semirecumbent position. However, our findings suggest that conventional protective measures such as semicircumstance testing and yearly check-up of cigarette leaking during hand placement do not suffice to prevent gastrial contents from asping in this manner. Further studies are needed to determine whether this drug actually prevents ventilator-associated pneumonia, bronchitis or  asthma attacks.</text>
