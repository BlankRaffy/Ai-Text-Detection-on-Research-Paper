    <text>Pediatric porcine models have demonstrated improved pulmonary mechanics, gas flow, and ventilation in response to acute, severe methacholine-induced bronchospasm. Heliox should be considered for the treatment of such conditions, particularly when treating pediatric patients with mechanical ventilation using small artificial airways.</text>

    <text>Measuring fertilization-induced calcium transients provides a novel experimental technique for studying C. elegans. Researchers can now examine thousands of mutants with fertilizer defects to determine whether there are any defects in the calcium transfer. The availability of forward genetic (gene knockout and RNAi) methods in Cryobacterium enables the testing of proteins believed to be involved in this crucial step of embryogenesis.</text>
