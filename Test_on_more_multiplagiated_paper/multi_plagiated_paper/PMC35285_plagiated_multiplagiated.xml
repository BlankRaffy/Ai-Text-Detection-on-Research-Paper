    <text>The absence of mutations in the desmuslin gene did not impact its function. Nevertheless, the single-nucleotide polymorphisms mapped in this study are highly disequilibrated and can be used for disambiguation studies of this region of chromosome 15q26.3.</text>

    <text>It is crucial to understand the cellular immune response by considering major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules as small peptides with restricted amino acid sequences that can be presented to T cells.</text>

    <text>While DHBV RNAseH activity was detectable on a set of neo-Nazi (NH2) heteroduplexes produced by cyclic DNA syntheses within DNHC during viral reverse transcription, it was not possible to detect NSDH through NEDH.</text>
