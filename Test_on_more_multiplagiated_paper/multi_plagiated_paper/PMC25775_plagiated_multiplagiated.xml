    <text>Our findings suggest that Stylonychia contains an inverted repeat with the core sequence 5'-TGAA located in both subtelomeric regions, which functions as a Cbs in this ciliate.</text>

    <text>NFAT is a family of transcriptional activators that promote the expression of immunomodulatory cytokines. Individual members of this family, such as p, nfatc, and ficus/x, are involved in the activation of genes such alsosaccharides, cardiac muscle-specific differentiation factors, (NFATAg) regulation of oocytes, cardiovascular development, immunity, or survival.</text>

    <text>A set of unsupervised and supervised shaving methods has been proposed to isolate intriguing gene clusters from DNA microarray experiments. These methods can use any available information, including class labels or survival time, to search for genes with high variation across all samples and correlation. Additional prognostic factors may be necessary for predicting the outcome using other methods.</text>
