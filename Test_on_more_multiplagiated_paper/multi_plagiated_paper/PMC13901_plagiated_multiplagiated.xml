    <text>The expression of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which encode breast cancer susceptibility genes, involves complex and multiple cellular functions. Although there is significant evidence linking these genes to homologous recombination, transcriptional control, and tissue proliferation, there is controversy over whether these genes are localized to nucleus or cytoplasm, and whether the expression of these genes is retained in premeiotic germ cells or can still be expressed in mitotic spermatogonia. We present an immunohistochemical study of BRC2-based mice mice mice rats.

    <text>It can be inferred that in Thai HIV-infected patients, both opportunistic and non-oprivunistic intestinal parasite infections are still highly prevalent. In the management of HIV-affected patients in Thailand with or without diarrhea symptom relief, stool examination is still a valuable investigation. Therefore, it is recommended to suspect ocdogenous intestinal parasits in all patients with low immunity presenting with diarrhea if such parasite infection is detected. However, attention should also be directed towards tropical epidemic infections.</text>
