    <text>The expression of BRCA1 and BCRA2 genes, which encode breast cancer susceptibility genes in humans, is accompanied by multiple complex cellular functions. However, there is significant evidence linking these genes to homologous recombination, transcriptional control, tissue proliferation, and the localization of their proteins to nucleus or cytoplasm. Nevertheless, it is uncertain whether these 2 genes are expressed in premeiotic germ cells or can still be expressed independently in mitotic spermatogonia. We present an immunohistochemical study of this gene expression pattern that leads patients.</text>

    <text>There are three homologous members of the Fragile X Mental Retardation protein family. The Fragument induced supramenopausal (FMRP) is caused by the x-linked FMR1 gene, which has been linked to human hereditary mental retardation. These proteins contain two KH domains and a RGG box, and are associated with nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal(NES) within actively translating ribosomes. However, it is unclear whether these genes can compensate for the absence of FMRP in this condition.</text>

    <text>It can be concluded that in Thai HIV-infected patients, both opportunistic and non-obstructive intestinal parasite infections are still highly prevalent. In the management of HIVâ€“infection patients in Thailand with or without diarrhea symptom, stool examination is still useful; therefore, as previously reported, any patient with low immunity presenting with diarrhea should suspect a ophinominal infection (the importance of tropical epidemic non Oporiotic small bug infections should not be neglected).</text>
