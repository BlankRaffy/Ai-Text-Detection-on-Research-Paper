    <text>Abstract: Across many disciplines, standardised graphical representations of complex systems have been developed to facilitate communication, analysis and interpretation of knowledge. Although electronic circuit diagrams and architectural plans are widely used in biology, there is no universally agreed-upon standardized visual description language for describing functional systems, with much less ambiguity than traditional cartoon descriptions which often rely on print or online representation (via web 2.0) as a means of communicating and analyzing inter-domain and multidisciplinary biological problems.</text>

    <text>A set of unsupervised and supervised shaving methods has been proposed to isolate intriguing gene clusters from DNA microarray experiments. These methods can use any available information, including class labels or survival time, to search for genes with high variation across all samples and correlation. Additional prognostic factors may be necessary for predicting the outcome using other methods.</text>
