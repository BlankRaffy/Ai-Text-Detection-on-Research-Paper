    <text>Bacillus anthracis and Yersinia pestis are classified as having an average density of tandem repeat arrays over 100 bp in comparison to other bacterial genomes studied so far, and testing a fraction of these sequences for polymorphism yielded dozens of informative markers, some of which displayed remarkably high levels of polychromatisim, including allele length from 600-1950 bps and nine all√®les resolved in the small number of independent Bacilles strains typed here.</text>

    <text>The role of dystrophin and its associated proteins in the anchoring of the muscle cell membrane to the extracellular matrix is known from the phylogenetic analysis of muscular dystrophy, with the absence of these proteins leading to this phenotype.</text>

    <text>Using our knowledge of the cloning of mouse (RPTP) cDNA, the genomic structure and alternative splicing techniques of human genes, and of an 8 kb 3'UTR in human(P)-ATP complex, we propose that the largest known non-human RPTM gene, extending over 1 megabase pairs of genomic DNA, is due to expanded introns in the extracellular region; the protein domains of Peptides are encoded by modules that are flanked only by phase 0, and also by other two additional from </text>
