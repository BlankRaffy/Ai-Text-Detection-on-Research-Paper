    <text>Copper and pentachlorophenol were found to be particularly toxic to PE in C. reinhardtii, with zinc being moderately toxic and nickel and lead acting as stimulants on PE. High variation in the molecular model makes it difficult to use motility as a reliable way to assess the toxicity of these compounds using Cryoma pneumoniae.</text>

    <text>Despite the increasing understanding of osteoclast's role in bone resorption, there is still not enough information about how these cells are formed. The most significant finding is that the anti-resorbing agent 17-estradiol has been associated with reduced morphology and the disappearance of marrow in mice treated with estrogen.</text>

    <text>The SouthEast has significant differences in antibiotic policies, with differing structures and contents. It is anticipated that this review will result in a revision to current recommendations, as the primary objective is to maintain an effective range of antibiotics. Local ownership by all prescribers and effective monitoring are necessary for compliance with local antibiotic policy. The most important task is developing an evidence base that can support both the content and implementation of policies across the country.</text>
