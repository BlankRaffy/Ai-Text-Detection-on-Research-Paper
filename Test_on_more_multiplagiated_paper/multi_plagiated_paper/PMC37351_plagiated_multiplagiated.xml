    <text>The leucine-rich repeat superfamily comprises right-handed beta helix proteins like pectate lyase and the L domains of members of the insulin receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor families, as indicated by multiple sequence alignments and comparisons between different 3D structures.</text>

    <text>Schizophrenia is one of the most common mental disorders among adolescents and young adults, but the pathophysiology and etiology of this condition is still unclear. While many studies have suggested that the change in the dopamine system is related to schizophrenia, there is limited direct evidence for the &quot;dopa hypothesis&quot;. Recent research has shown that molecular biology and imaging techniques have provided sufficient information about the relationship between dope and dopetamine receptors, with little direct support.</text>

    <text>By comparing the sequences of Drosophila and C. elegans with human sequence information, we have identified 39 families of C2H2 ZNF genes with no known codons. Of these, only 17 have been defined so far, and we believe that there are 38 distinct groups of orthologous genes, each deriving from a single gene in the ancestor of these three organisms (the most recent example of this finding). Based on current metazoan phylogeny, corresponding members of each group represent smallest possible for all indicating that it was possible to form</text>
