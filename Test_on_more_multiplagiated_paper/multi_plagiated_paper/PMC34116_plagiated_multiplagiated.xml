    <text>The absence of mutations in the desmuslin gene did not impact its function. Nevertheless, the single-nucleotide polymorphisms mapped in this study are highly disequilibrated and can be used for disambiguation studies of this region of chromosome 15q26.3.</text>

    <text>Several laboratories have discovered that the transmembrane proteins of several RNA viruses share essential structural and functional elements for virus entry, including a hydrophobic region and fibrous structure defined by two antiparallel alpha helices. This is particularly true for certain viruses like Ebola and Rous sarcoma, as well as other family members. Recent biophysical studies have supported the idea that these viral proteins share similar structural similarities with one another, such as GP-1 and GG-2.</text>

    <text>In conclusion, our investigation demonstrates that GCNF has a conserved structure, enables the confirmation and systematic review of splice variants, and could potentially enhance our understanding of human CGNF. The intron-exon boundaries of the human gene are consistent with the high level of amino-acid conservation between the mouse and human proteins, while alternative coding methods like cIF-26 enable the expression of several protein regulators.</text>
