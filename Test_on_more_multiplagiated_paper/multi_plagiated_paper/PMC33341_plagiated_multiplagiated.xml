    <text>By examining the effects of hyperosmotic stress and intracellular acidification on endocytosis, we propose that both hypoxia by high pH and reduced cellular activity are mediated by pleiotropic effects.</text>

    <text>The impact of glucocorticoids on various cellular functions is regulated by their interaction with soluble intracellular receptors. In most cells, unliganded GRs are located in the cytoplasm as a heteromeric complex composed mostly of heat shock proteins (hsp90 and hr70) or other proteins. NLSs act as an intermediate site for repressing the formation of primary response genes by binding to greaves. However, there is limited information available on how this mechanism is controlled.</text>

    <text>Measuring fertilization-induced calcium transients provides a novel experimental technique for studying C. elegans. Researchers can now examine thousands of mutants with fertilizer defects to determine whether there are any defects in the calcium transfer. The availability of forward genetic (gene knockout and RNAi) methods in Cryobacterium enables the testing of proteins believed to be involved in this crucial step of embryogenesis.</text>
