    <text>The UDGs are a single superfamily that has essentially the same structural fold and an evolutionary commonality between them, but differences in the catalytic mechanism and pocket constructions have led to extreme sequence divergence of these enzymes.</text>

    <text>During various cellular processes, the p53 tumor suppressor gene can cause DNA damage due to Ionizing Radiation and genotoxic agents, as well as during the progression of primary cells to senescence. It also functions as a transcriptional regulator by activating sequence-specific DNA binding activity and acting as an inhibitor of mdm2-p54 regulation.</text>

    <text>Findings indicate that ethylene, which is produced by ethephon, was found to mediate intracellular calcium level ([Ca2+]i) in mouse NIH-3T3 and human HeLa and SaOS-2 cells. These findings provide support for previous findings of increased [Cava2 +]inhibition, as well as an increase in the expression of an enriched form-factor gene, SDERR, in invertebrate cells (primmorphs of the marine sponge S. domuncula).</text>
