    <text>The initial functional indication of the enhancement of SERCA pumping ability in ER stressed cells is presented by these findings. As three distinct and unrelated mechanisms elicited the functional upregulation of Ca2+ transport into the ED, these results provide evidence that the regulation of at least one SERP pump isoform is involved in the induction of UPR.</text>

    <text>The occurrence of X-linked agammaglobulinemia (reviewed in reference) is caused by Btk mutations. This protein is expressed through a defect in the B cell that blocks the pro-B cell transition and leads to no mature B cells.</text>

    <text>The 1 subunit has the ability to selectively modulate the pore function of the DHS without affecting the movement of charged electrons or the voltage dependence of Ca2+ transients, unlike other DHPR subsubunits that perform both functions. In all likelihood, the charge movement protocol failed to detect small and relatively small charge movements responsible for opening the Ca 2+ channel, which are only resolved for depolarizations larger than 200 ms (Fig. 4). However, since the protocol is accurate in detecting any variation in immobilization of these charges</text>
