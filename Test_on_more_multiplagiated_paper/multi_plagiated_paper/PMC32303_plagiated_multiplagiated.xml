    <text>The recognition of RNA-proteins is one of the most well-known by genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches. The primary and secondary structures of operator ARN are illustrated in Figure 1. This enables the formation of contacts with both subunits of coat protein. However, X-ray crystallography fails to identify specific amino acid-nucleotide contacts, leading to non-identical interactions between A-4 and A-10 that play a significant role in regulating repression of DNA.</text>

    <text>We have developed an algorithm for mapping the positively selected mutations of viral quasispecies using sequence data. This method was used to map the positive selected variants (for example, those of influenza A HA, HIV-1 RT and HIV-120), as well as other obvious examples of selective mapping targeting viral subpopulations under different selective pressures: For example we used selection mapping of HIV isolates with different cellular tropisms; another application of this principle is possible for HIV breakthrough infections where we determined whether vaccines prevented the HIV quasivalent vaccine substances from a greater distance</text>
