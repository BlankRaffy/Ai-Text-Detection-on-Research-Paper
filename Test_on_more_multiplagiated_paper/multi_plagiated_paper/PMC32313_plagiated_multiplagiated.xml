    <text>Based on these data, Btk:ER is thought to regulate downstream signaling pathways in B cells primarily via PLC2 (i.e., regulatory protein coupled with nuclear protein chainase inhibitor PLSI 2), and thus it is not known whether activated BukR/STK copy-pasteurs interact with activatededBtky receptor expressed as a &quot;conditional system&quot;, but this condition will probably allow for the dissection of Btons' (and other) role in various biological processes in many cell types.</text>

    <text>During the last few years, it became increasingly common for bacteria to have two-component systems that were thought to function as independent pathways. However, recent research by Posas et al. has shown that these systems are more than just components of a single enzyme; in fact, most of the time they serve as both forms of signalling and reversal mechanisms.</text>

    <text>Our findings reveal that there are many novel candidate downstream genes of the homeodomain transcription factor Lab, but not all of them have been classified as lab targets. We do not know for certain which genes are directly or indirectly regulated by Lab protein binding to DNA regulatory sequences. However, our results indicate that oligonucleotide arrays can be used to analyze candidate downregulation genes at a genome-wide level, providing further evidence for the usefulness of microarrays in studying diverse molecular and cellular processes in Drosophila.</text>
