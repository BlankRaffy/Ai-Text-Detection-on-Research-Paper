    <text>Olfaction is a crucial neurosensory activity in mammals that involves analyzing the chemical environment surrounding them. The first step in identifying scents is the interaction between an odorant and its receptors, which are located at the surface of cilia in the olfactory area. Seven-transmembrane ORs were identified in 1991 as the largest family of G-protein-coupled receptor (OR) proteins, representing classical OR categories from Class I or A. Each molecule recognizes multiple scented or other active motifs.</text>
