    <infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon>
    <text>Our findings indicate that NFATp is a genuine transcriptional activator. Furthermore, our new formulations and techniques will aid in future investigations into the mechanisms of transcriptionally activation and nuclear accumulation by NPAT1, which belongs to an important family of transcriptal regulatory proteins.</text>

    <text>During various cellular processes, the p53 tumor suppressor gene can cause DNA damage due to Ionizing Radiation and genotoxic agents, as well as during the progression of primary cells to senescence. It also functions as a transcriptional regulator by activating sequence-specific DNA binding activity and acting as an inhibitor of mdm2-p54 regulation.</text>

    <text>While DHBV RNAseH activity was detectable on a set of neo-Nazi (NH2) heteroduplexes produced by cyclic DNA syntheses within DNHC during viral reverse transcription, it was not possible to detect NSDH through NEDH.</text>
