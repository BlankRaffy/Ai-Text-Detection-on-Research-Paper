    <text>We found that even in patients kept in a semirecumbent position, aspiration of gastric contents still occurs and this finding was correct. Cisapride reduced the amount of airway gastritis associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients, but it did not prevent complete gastrinary aspartam inciprance (even when the patient was in the semirest position).</text>

    <text>Despite the fact that RAR isoforms are transcription factors controlling various endocrine pathways, there is no evidence to support this claim. We believe that identifying novel molecules with anti-cancer activity could be crucial for the development of novel drugs against breast cancer, as both agonists and antagonists can display antitumor activity.</text>

    <text>The absence of a dinucleotide repeat polymacy in the ER gene flanking those affected by AITDs was found in our data. However, this does not necessarily mean that the other polymorphisms within the same gene are completely unrelated to AITTs. Furthermore, there are limitations in using microsatellite markers with multiple allleles; although our results may indicate 'vast diversity in genetic backgrounds' of AITBs, which we believe should need more analysis from larger groups, but still needless influencing the decision</text>
