    <text>Astrocytes are the dominant type of cell in central nervous system and play a significant role in modulating neuronal activity. They have also been shown to be involved in several physiopathological brain events, including the synthesis and secretion of neurotrophic growth factors. However, there is no consensus on whether these connections, which involve specific intercellular connections or selective release of chemical signals from mammalian astrocytes, are solely responsible for modulation of intracellular Ca2+ waves.</text>

    <text>The findings indicate that myelin may have a role in promoting the growth of neurites by disrupting their normal organization within white matter.</text>
