    <text>Using our knowledge of the cloning of mouse (RPTP) cDNA, the genomic structure and alternative splicing techniques of human genes, and of an 8 kb 3'UTR in human(P)-ATP complex, we propose that the largest known non-human RPTM gene, extending over 1 megabase pairs of genomic DNA, is due to expanded introns in the extracellular region; the protein domains of Peptides are encoded by modules that are flanked only by phase 0, and also by other two additional from </text>
