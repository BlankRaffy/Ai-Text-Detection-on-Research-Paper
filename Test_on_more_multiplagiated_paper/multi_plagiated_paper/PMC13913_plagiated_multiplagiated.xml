    <text>At the secondary lymphoid organs, efficient interactions between T, B and antigen-presenting cells occur. T cells are primarily located in the paracortical zone, which includes interfollicular regions. Small primary fojicles inthe cortex become secondary fungus or germinal centres (GCs) after antigenic stimulation. Technically, the development of the GC reaction is mediated by both cellular contacts and humoral factors such as CD40L (assisted metochortic acid) expressed by T cell also activated B cells that produce memory B</text>
