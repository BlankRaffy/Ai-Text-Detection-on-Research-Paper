    <text>The recognition of RNA-proteins is one of the most well-known by genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches. The primary and secondary structures of operator ARN are illustrated in Figure 1. This enables the formation of contacts with both subunits of coat protein. However, X-ray crystallography fails to identify specific amino acid-nucleotide contacts, leading to non-identical interactions between A-4 and A-10 that play a significant role in regulating repression of DNA.</text>
