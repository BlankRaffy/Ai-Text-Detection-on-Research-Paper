    <text>The risk of breast cancer may be linked to polymorphisms in the ADRB2 and ADRP3 genes; further studies with larger samples and/or in diverse ethnic groups are needed to explore this possibility.</text>

    <text>Earlier studies have shown that there is a significant genetic influence on the development of Type I diabetes nephropathy. This was confirmed by investigating the impact of apopolipoprotein E (apoE) polymorphism on diabetic patients' micro- and macrovascular complications. The discovery of three common alleles, E2, E3, and E4 that encode three major isoforms has increased diabetically for APOE. Individuals with EPA2 are more likely to have elevated plasma cholesterol levels and may also have an important genetic effect.</text>

    <text>In this report, we describe how we have found RAR agonists with unique structural properties, thanks to the rapid discovery of new ones using a powerful virtual-ligand screening approach and avoiding the use of existing research strategies. The study presents one of the molecules as an example of these new pathways that could provide more favorable structural characteristics and potentially become valuable in cancer therapy.</text>
