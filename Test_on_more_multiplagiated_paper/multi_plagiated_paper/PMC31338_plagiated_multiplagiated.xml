    <text>The EYFP and ECFP reporter strains are more effective in detecting lacZ expression in living tissue than lac Z reporter lines, which cannot be easily detected in these tissues. They can track the lineage of Cre cells and their descendants in cultured embryos or organs without overlapping emission spectra.</text>
