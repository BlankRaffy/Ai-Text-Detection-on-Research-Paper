    <text>Despite the fact that some of the mechanisms for cell morphogenesis, such as membrane vesicle transport, are conserved in crown eukaryotes (metazoa, fungi, and plants), others, like those involving extracellular structures or the specific roles of different Rho-like GTPases, often recruit conservens from other cellular processes.</text>

    <text>Using the tree harvest procedure, we will attempt to find additive and interaction structure among clusters of genes that relate to an outcome measure. This method is particularly challenging due to the limited number of available samples for this particular purpose. We will initially use a stepwise strategy using the sum and products of the average gene expression of chosen cluster(s) of trees to learn about gene activity in larger data sets (details here). We believe that models could be constructed from these clustered models, as other methods including tree-based models or boosting techniques.</text>
