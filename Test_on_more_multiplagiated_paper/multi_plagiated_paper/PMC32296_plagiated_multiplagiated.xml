    <text>Disruption of spinal cord white matter and sciatic nerve geometry inhibits axonal growth in vitro in the absence of glial scarring</text>

    <text>The findings indicate that glial scar-related factors are not required to prevent axonal growth at injury sites. However, disruption of fiber tract geometry, possibly through myelin-associated neurite-growth inhibitors, may be adequate to create regrowth barriers in spinal cord white matter and peripheral nerves.</text>

    <text>The previous belief that axonal growth within white matter was impossible was supported by well-documented evidence of this. However, recent research has shown that CNS myelin-associated molecules such as Nogo (formerly NI-35/250) and chondroitin meiosin-2 can effectively inhibit neurite growth.</text>

    <text>Heliox demonstrated an improvement in pulmonary mechanics in patients with severe methacholine-induced bronchospasm and a pediatric porcine model of independent lung mechanical ventilation, as measured by helioX at the same ventilator setting. The authors suggest that this type of therapy may be useful for children with small endotracheal tubes, high airway resistance, and delayed progress towards ventilated children.</text>
