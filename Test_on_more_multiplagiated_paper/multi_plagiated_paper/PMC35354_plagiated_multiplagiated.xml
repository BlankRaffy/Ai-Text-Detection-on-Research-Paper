    <text>Our technology enables non-invasive screening of large numbers of mice for ECG changes caused by genetic, pharmacological, or pathophysiological changes. Not only does this match the data reported so far with expensive and invasive methods, but it also provides new insights into gender- and age-dependent differences in EKGs in mice.</text>

    <text>Schizophrenia is one of the most common mental disorders among adolescents and young adults, but the pathophysiology and etiology of this condition is still unclear. While many studies have suggested that the change in the dopamine system is related to schizophrenia, there is limited direct evidence for the &quot;dopa hypothesis&quot;. Recent research has shown that molecular biology and imaging techniques have provided sufficient information about the relationship between dope and dopetamine receptors, with little direct support.</text>

    <text>Using a combination of sequence analyses and 3D structure comparisons, we have demonstrated that the L domains of members of the IR and EGFR subfamilies, as well as those of other LRRs such as porcine ribonucleases, exhibit variations of this typical repeating motif.</text>
