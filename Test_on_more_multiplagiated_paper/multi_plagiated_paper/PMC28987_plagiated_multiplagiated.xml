    <text>The process of fertilization in animals produces intracellular calcium dynamics that is necessary for normal development. The differences in calcium wave patterns between animals vary from single calcium transients to complex events. In certain cases, such as echinoderms, fish, and frogs (echiodermatians and ascidians), the release of internal calcium stores by inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3). It is unclear how early on this occurs, as only diazed oocytes are formed during embryon</text>

    <text>In summary, we found that cisapride reduces the risk of gastric contents aspiration in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients who are kept in a semirecumbent position. However, our findings suggest that conventional protective measures such as semicircumstance testing and yearly check-up of cigarette leaking during hand placement do not suffice to prevent gastrial contents from asping in this manner. Further studies are needed to determine whether this drug actually prevents ventilator-associated pneumonia, bronchitis or  asthma attacks.</text>
