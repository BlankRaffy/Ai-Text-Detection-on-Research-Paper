    <infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon>
    <text>By integrating CORBA into existing systems and providing users with built-in clients for their applications, we can provide a more efficient way to access EMBL data while reducing the challenges of traditional flat-file formats.</text>

    <text>Abstract: Across many disciplines, standardised graphical representations of complex systems have been developed to facilitate communication, analysis and interpretation of knowledge. Although electronic circuit diagrams and architectural plans are widely used in biology, there is no universally agreed-upon standardized visual description language for describing functional systems, with much less ambiguity than traditional cartoon descriptions which often rely on print or online representation (via web 2.0) as a means of communicating and analyzing inter-domain and multidisciplinary biological problems.</text>

    <text>The quality of the annotation for a new genome is likely to be equal to that of its predecessor, as it takes into account the phylogenetic principle of protein classification, which involves clustering organisms by (probable) orthology and invests considerable effort in functional characterization and classification of these COGs.</text>
