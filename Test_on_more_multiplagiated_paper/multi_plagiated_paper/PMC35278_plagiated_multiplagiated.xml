    <text>During the last few years, it became increasingly common for bacteria to have two-component systems that were thought to function as independent pathways. However, recent research by Posas et al. has shown that these systems are more than just components of a single enzyme; in fact, most of the time they serve as both forms of signalling and reversal mechanisms.</text>

    <text>In conclusion, our investigation demonstrates that GCNF has a conserved structure, enables the confirmation and systematic review of splice variants, and could potentially enhance our understanding of human CGNF. The intron-exon boundaries of the human gene are consistent with the high level of amino-acid conservation between the mouse and human proteins, while alternative coding methods like cIF-26 enable the expression of several protein regulators.</text>
