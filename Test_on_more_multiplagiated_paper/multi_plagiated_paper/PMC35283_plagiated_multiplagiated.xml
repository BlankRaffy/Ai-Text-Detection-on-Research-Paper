    <text>MCM2 - a promising marker for premalignant lesions of the lung: a cohort study</text>

    <text>We find that MCM2 is detectable in premalignant lung cells that are 2-3 times more proliferating than Ki-67. The fact that it is present in cells at the surface of metaplastic lung lesions, which are more likely to be exfoliated into sputum, lends support to its use as an early marker for significantly enhancing lung cancer survival rates through anti-MCM2 therapy.</text>

    <text>Despite progress in treating asthma and reactive bronchospasm since his introduction of heliox in 1935, mortality remains high due to inadequate treatment.</text>

    <text>Lastly, we demonstrate with various antibodies that both broad-spectrum BRCA1 and BRAC2 proteins are widely expressed in two types of non-embryogenic human tissues associated with the cell cycle: Brahmi1, Brca1 (B.rogena) and Brrgium2. Britain1 is expressed during growth and differentiation in the ovary, while Braz2 is present outside the site of spermatogenesis.</text>
