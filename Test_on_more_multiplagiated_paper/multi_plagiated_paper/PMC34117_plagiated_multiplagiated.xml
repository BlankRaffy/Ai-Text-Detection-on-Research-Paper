    <text>We find that MCM2 is detectable in premalignant lung cells that are 2-3 times more proliferating than Ki-67. The fact that it is present in cells at the surface of metaplastic lung lesions, which are more likely to be exfoliated into sputum, lends support to its use as an early marker for significantly enhancing lung cancer survival rates through anti-MCM2 therapy.</text>

    <text>The impact of glucocorticoids on various cellular functions is regulated by their interaction with soluble intracellular receptors. In most cells, unliganded GRs are located in the cytoplasm as a heteromeric complex composed mostly of heat shock proteins (hsp90 and hr70) or other proteins. NLSs act as an intermediate site for repressing the formation of primary response genes by binding to greaves. However, there is limited information available on how this mechanism is controlled.</text>

    <text>In summary, we found that cisapride reduces the risk of gastric contents aspiration in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients who are kept in a semirecumbent position. However, our findings suggest that conventional protective measures such as semicircumstance testing and yearly check-up of cigarette leaking during hand placement do not suffice to prevent gastrial contents from asping in this manner. Further studies are needed to determine whether this drug actually prevents ventilator-associated pneumonia, bronchitis or  asthma attacks.</text>
