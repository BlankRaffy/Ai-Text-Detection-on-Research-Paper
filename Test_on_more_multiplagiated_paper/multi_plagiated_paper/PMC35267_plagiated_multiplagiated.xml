    <text>Using computational methods, the structure of Eukaryotic cap MTase was predicted to be reconstructed using evolutionary relationships. The identification of novel cap (cap) metabolites suggests candidates for cloning and biochemical characterization, while the structural model will be useful in designing new experiments to understand the molecular function of cap caps.</text>

    <text>Abstract: Across many disciplines, standardised graphical representations of complex systems have been developed to facilitate communication, analysis and interpretation of knowledge. Although electronic circuit diagrams and architectural plans are widely used in biology, there is no universally agreed-upon standardized visual description language for describing functional systems, with much less ambiguity than traditional cartoon descriptions which often rely on print or online representation (via web 2.0) as a means of communicating and analyzing inter-domain and multidisciplinary biological problems.</text>

    <text>Using our knowledge of the cloning of mouse (RPTP) cDNA, the genomic structure and alternative splicing techniques of human genes, and of an 8 kb 3'UTR in human(P)-ATP complex, we propose that the largest known non-human RPTM gene, extending over 1 megabase pairs of genomic DNA, is due to expanded introns in the extracellular region; the protein domains of Peptides are encoded by modules that are flanked only by phase 0, and also by other two additional from </text>
