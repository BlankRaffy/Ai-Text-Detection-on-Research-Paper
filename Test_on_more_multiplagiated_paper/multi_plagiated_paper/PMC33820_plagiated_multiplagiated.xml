    <text>The specificity of HLA-E is possibly not as exquisite as previously thought because it appears to refold around a random peptide library in comparison to the results obtained with classical class Ia MHC molecules, namely RT1-A1c and RAu, and can associate with synthetic peptides carrying an HIV sequence, suggesting that it could bind different phenotypes and present them to T lymphocytes.</text>

    <text>During replication, Hepadnaviruses use reverse transcription of pregenomic RNA molecules. The viral viruses initiate replication by interacting with the viral reverse transcriptase (P) and using a primer to bind to the 5' copy of  before starting DNA synthesis.</text>

    <text>Using our knowledge of the cloning of mouse (RPTP) cDNA, the genomic structure and alternative splicing techniques of human genes, and of an 8 kb 3'UTR in human(P)-ATP complex, we propose that the largest known non-human RPTM gene, extending over 1 megabase pairs of genomic DNA, is due to expanded introns in the extracellular region; the protein domains of Peptides are encoded by modules that are flanked only by phase 0, and also by other two additional from </text>
