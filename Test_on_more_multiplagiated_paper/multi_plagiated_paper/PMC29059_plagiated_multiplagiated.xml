    <text>The process of fertilization in animals produces intracellular calcium dynamics that is necessary for normal development. The differences in calcium wave patterns between animals vary from single calcium transients to complex events. In certain cases, such as echinoderms, fish, and frogs (echiodermatians and ascidians), the release of internal calcium stores by inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3). It is unclear how early on this occurs, as only diazed oocytes are formed during embryon</text>

    <text>A straightforward method for measuring LDL oxidation susceptibility in vitro has been developed, which has also been tested on patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy volunteers. This approach could allow for comparison of results from more general clinical laboratories, allowing us to move towards standardization of a procedure of potential clinical significance.</text>
