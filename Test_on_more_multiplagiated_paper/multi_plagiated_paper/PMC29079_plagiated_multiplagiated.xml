    <text>By examining only the differentiated or undifferentiated phenotype of the GL15 cell line, researchers can provide a reliable in vitro model for astrocytes, which can help to understand their essential physiological functions. Furthermore, the proposed model can also investigate the mechanism by which these cells interact with each other, particularly in relation to the human origin of this cell type.</text>
