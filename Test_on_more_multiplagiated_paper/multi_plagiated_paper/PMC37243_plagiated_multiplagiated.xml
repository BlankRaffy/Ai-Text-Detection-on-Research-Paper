    <text>The results of our study support the hypothesis that zebrafish Delta proteins, which are expressed by newly specified neurons, promote Notch activity in neighboring precursors. This signaling is necessary to maintain a proliferative precursor population and generate late-born neurons and glia. As argued, Delta-Notch signalling may diversify vertebrate neural cell fates by coordinating cell cycle control and cell specification.</text>

    <text>We have recently identified ethylene as a key regulator of plant growth, development and senescence. It is also involved in various stress responses such as activation of the calcium/protein phosphate receptor (PAP) and modulation or even death of cells caused by starvation.</text>

    <text>These studies suggest that PP5 plays a role in controlling nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and that the suppression of pythonic regulatory protein 5 (PP5) leads to nuclear accumulation of highly reactive GRs without the presence of any hormone. This implies that there is likely more nuclear activity associated with the increase in generative gene expression (GR)-induced transcriptional activity after ISIS 15534 induced translation from Greek, suggesting that this may be due to either nuclear upregulation or export of genetically modified genes.</text>
