    <text>These studies propose a role for PP5 in the control of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of glucocorticoid receptors, and suggest that the transcriptional activity resulting from nuclear accumulation of highly bindable GR (like binding site) but still needing agonist to trigger maximum transcriptionally.</text>

    <text>During various cellular processes, the p53 tumor suppressor gene can cause DNA damage due to Ionizing Radiation and genotoxic agents, as well as during the progression of primary cells to senescence. It also functions as a transcriptional regulator by activating sequence-specific DNA binding activity and acting as an inhibitor of mdm2-p54 regulation.</text>

    <text>The discovery of Btk mutations in XLA patients and the xid mouse indicates that Bfk is essential for B cell development, but the necessary pathways for PLC activation have not been fully explored. In contrast, Bcm:ER activates several important downstream signaling pathways including PLM-mediated responses, Apoptosis-triggered responses (ApopT1), and ERK and JNK-activated genes. We propose that this approach can effectively activate Bpk as a conditional form of Brk:er on the same cells expressing an embryon</text>
