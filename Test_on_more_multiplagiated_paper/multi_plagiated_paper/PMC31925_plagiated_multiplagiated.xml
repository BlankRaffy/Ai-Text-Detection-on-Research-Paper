    <text>The outcomes indicate that the catabolism of the least common amino acid may have the potential to regulate processes like prostaglandin synthesis and cell adhesion.</text>

    <text>During various cellular processes, the p53 tumor suppressor gene can cause DNA damage due to Ionizing Radiation and genotoxic agents, as well as during the progression of primary cells to senescence. It also functions as a transcriptional regulator by activating sequence-specific DNA binding activity and acting as an inhibitor of mdm2-p54 regulation.</text>

    <text>Our results show that eukaryotic homologues of bacterial signal transduction systems may be involved in serine/threonine kinases, and that the serous phosphorylation of DokA (dominusculum dominusera), homologous to dokTAS, is not dependent on histidine residue, which is essential for two-component systems, as demonstrated in vivo.</text>
