    <text>Earlier studies have shown that there is a significant genetic influence on the development of Type I diabetes nephropathy. This was confirmed by investigating the impact of apopolipoprotein E (apoE) polymorphism on diabetic patients' micro- and macrovascular complications. The discovery of three common alleles, E2, E3, and E4 that encode three major isoforms has increased diabetically for APOE. Individuals with EPA2 are more likely to have elevated plasma cholesterol levels and may also have an important genetic effect.</text>

    <text>Research on the characterization of protein complexes in skeletal muscle and heart, including information regarding genotype-phenotype relationships, will contribute to understanding the pathophysiology of human muscle diseases. We encourage other groups to test for the C598T DMN mutation in their human patient samples affected by muscular and cardiac diseases as well as generate desmuslin null animal models to further understand this important protein.</text>
