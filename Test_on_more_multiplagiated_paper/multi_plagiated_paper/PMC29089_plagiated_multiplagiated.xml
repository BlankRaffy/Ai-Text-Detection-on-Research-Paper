    <text>We have developed a simple, fast and easy way of generating cDNA clone from genomic sequences. The full-length HOXD13 recombination (1.1 kb) produced using this method was confirmed by sequence analysis. This simple approach can be used to generate fullâ€“length copies of available partial genomic sequencing.</text>

    <text>Our findings suggest that the translational machinery interacts with stop codon contexts in different ways, and they also suggest similarities between these mechanisms in readthrough and eukaryotes.</text>
