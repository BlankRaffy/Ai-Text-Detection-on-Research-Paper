    <text>We found that even in patients kept in a semirecumbent position, aspiration of gastric contents still occurs and this finding was correct. Cisapride reduced the amount of airway gastritis associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients, but it did not prevent complete gastrinary aspartam inciprance (even when the patient was in the semirest position).</text>

    <text>After a prolonged storage period of 28 days at 4Â°C and 24 hours at room temperature, all six ternary unsupplemented controlled mixtures were stable enough for normal therapeutic use. The choice of triglyceride mixture used was determined solely by the clinical and metabolic requirements of each regimen, as all other stability tests confirmed their stability.</text>
