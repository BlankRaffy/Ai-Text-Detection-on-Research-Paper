    <text>In the southeast Anatolia region of Turkey, malaria has been a significant concern for tourists since 1992. In 1992, Diyarbakir city had the highest number of cases (4168) followed by SanliUrfa city (3578); in 1994 and 1995, there were more cases of spontaneous rupture of malarial spleen than elsewhere. We have reported two cases in 1998, which were both male. They came from males who were receiving chloroquine treatment and were later diagnosed with abdominal pain and fever.</text>

    <text>The significance of using functional and structural approaches to understand molecular interactions is highlighted by the fact that some contacts in the x-ray structure of the MS2 RNA-protein complex are significantly absent, while others remain significant. Figure 4 illustrates the important interactions at A-4 and A-10, including Val29 and Lys61.</text>
