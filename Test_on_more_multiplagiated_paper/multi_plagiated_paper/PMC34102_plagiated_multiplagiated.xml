    <text>A variety of nutrition packages are routinely used for peri-operative care, including packages containing different nutrients. Knowledge of the stability of these mixtures is essential to avoid dangerous fusions of unstable compounds. The most important factors affecting the size of emulsion particles are pH, electrolyte concentration, and amino acid and lipid composition. Low zeta potential indicates reduced stability; six combinations were tested for particle size. All contained formulae were stable for 28 days at room temperature with or without MCT.</text>

    <text>Measuring fertilization-induced calcium transients provides a novel experimental technique for studying C. elegans. Researchers can now examine thousands of mutants with fertilizer defects to determine whether there are any defects in the calcium transfer. The availability of forward genetic (gene knockout and RNAi) methods in Cryobacterium enables the testing of proteins believed to be involved in this crucial step of embryogenesis.</text>
