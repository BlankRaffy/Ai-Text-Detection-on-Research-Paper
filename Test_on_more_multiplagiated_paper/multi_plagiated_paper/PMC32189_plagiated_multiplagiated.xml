    <text>The definition of 11 GCNF coding exons on human chromosome 9 can be achieved by homology with the mouse gene, and all known cDNAs of human GCNNF are derived from mRNAs that are generated by splicing the fourth to the second exontium, despite the conservation of genomic sequences.</text>

    <text>The role of dystrophin and its associated proteins in the anchoring of the muscle cell membrane to the extracellular matrix is known from the phylogenetic analysis of muscular dystrophy, with the absence of these proteins leading to this phenotype.</text>

    <text>Using our knowledge of the cloning of mouse (RPTP) cDNA, the genomic structure and alternative splicing techniques of human genes, and of an 8 kb 3'UTR in human(P)-ATP complex, we propose that the largest known non-human RPTM gene, extending over 1 megabase pairs of genomic DNA, is due to expanded introns in the extracellular region; the protein domains of Peptides are encoded by modules that are flanked only by phase 0, and also by other two additional from </text>
