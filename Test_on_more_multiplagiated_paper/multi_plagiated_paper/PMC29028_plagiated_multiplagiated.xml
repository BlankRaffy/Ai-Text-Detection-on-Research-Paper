    <text>Abdominal compartment syndrome: does intra-cystic pressure reflect actual intra-abdominal pressure? A prospective study in surgical patients</text>

    <text>The intra-cystic pressure in the current study model did not accurately represent the intraâ€“abdominal pressure. &quot;We feel that further research is needed to identify other potential factors contributing to the relationship between the urinary bladder and abdominal cavity pressures, in order to provide a more accurate diagnosis of abdominal compartment syndrome.&quot;</text>

    <text>Abstract: Across many disciplines, standardised graphical representations of complex systems have been developed to facilitate communication, analysis and interpretation of knowledge. Although electronic circuit diagrams and architectural plans are widely used in biology, there is no universally agreed-upon standardized visual description language for describing functional systems, with much less ambiguity than traditional cartoon descriptions which often rely on print or online representation (via web 2.0) as a means of communicating and analyzing inter-domain and multidisciplinary biological problems.</text>

    <text>The significance of using functional and structural approaches to understand molecular interactions is highlighted by the fact that some contacts in the x-ray structure of the MS2 RNA-protein complex are significantly absent, while others remain significant. Figure 4 illustrates the important interactions at A-4 and A-10, including Val29 and Lys61.</text>
