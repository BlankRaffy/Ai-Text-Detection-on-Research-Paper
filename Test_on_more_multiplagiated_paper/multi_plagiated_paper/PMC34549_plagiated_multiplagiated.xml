    <text>The absence of mutations in the desmuslin gene did not impact its function. Nevertheless, the single-nucleotide polymorphisms mapped in this study are highly disequilibrated and can be used for disambiguation studies of this region of chromosome 15q26.3.</text>

    <text>AS is a disease that affects the axial skeleton and results in periphery mono-/oligoarthritis. In some cases, AS looks like RA with intense mononuclear cell infiltration forming foci similar to germinal centers (GC) that contain B and T lymphocytes as well as plasma cells. Recent immunohistologic analysis of five AS SMs revealed that only 123 (44 functional) VH segments were rearranged into different categories of VHDs, with only CPD leads lead to an over</text>

    <text>The protein-coding region of GCNF, which is located within 11 exons, will need further investigation to define the regulatory/promoter region. The genomic structure of the sixth subfamily of nuclear receptors will be crucial for future research on this specific receptor.</text>
