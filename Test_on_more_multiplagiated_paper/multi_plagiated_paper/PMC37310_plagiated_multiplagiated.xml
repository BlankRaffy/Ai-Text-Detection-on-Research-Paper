    <infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon>
    <text>Diabetic retinopathy is not a known genetic susceptibility for Type I diabetes patients, regardless of whether APOE gene polymorphism is present. The relationship between apoelo-related genes and diabetic nephropathy may be weak or moderate, but not very strong.</text>

    <text>The role of dystrophin and its associated proteins in the anchoring of the muscle cell membrane to the extracellular matrix is known from the phylogenetic analysis of muscular dystrophy, with the absence of these proteins leading to this phenotype.</text>

    <text>The use of mRNA differential display was employed to identify genes that have been altered in Pneumocystis carinii-infected hosts. The nucleotide sequence of one of the fragments displayed in the differentially determined expression corresponded to the gene encoding the rat mitochondrial ATPase 6, which is a subunit of F0F1-ATP synthases. Northern blot analysis of total RNA extracted from P. carINiI-treated rDNA lining the distal regions, as well as</text>
