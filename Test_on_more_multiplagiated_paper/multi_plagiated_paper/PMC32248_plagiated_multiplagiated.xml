    <text>Site-specific mutations of FtsZ - effects on GTPase and in vitro assembly</text>

    <text>Some mutants containing reduced GTPase still complement ftsZ84, suggesting that the high level of GATPases observed in vitro is not necessary for in vivo function. However, all of the lateral mutant fail to complement it, indicating that these surfaces of various protofilaments may play a role in association with Ftz protofilements, which may be different from the structures assembled in DEAE dextran or calcium.</text>

    <text>The CFTR is a low-conductance, cyclic nucleotide-regulated channel that regulates the conductance of calcium and other organic molecules. It has also been detected in vascular endothelium and can modulate these functions.</text>

    <text>Our results show that eukaryotic homologues of bacterial signal transduction systems may be involved in serine/threonine kinases, and that the serous phosphorylation of DokA (dominusculum dominusera), homologous to dokTAS, is not dependent on histidine residue, which is essential for two-component systems, as demonstrated in vivo.</text>
