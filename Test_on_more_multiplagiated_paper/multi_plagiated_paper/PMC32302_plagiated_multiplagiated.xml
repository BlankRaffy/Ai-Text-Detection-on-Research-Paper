    <text>The Harvard Medical Practice Study (HMPS) investigated the epidemiology of iatrogenic injuries caused by unintended adverse reactions and medical care complications, specifically &quot;adverse events&quot;, with results showing that 3.4% of patients discharged from New York state in 1984 persisted after 14% death. As a result, the HM PSAs have been used to estimate rates for the US general population, which may not be appropriate given that the study was limited to observing data from HBPCs and surveys.</text>

    <text>In summary, we found that cisapride reduces the risk of gastric contents aspiration in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients who are kept in a semirecumbent position. However, our findings suggest that conventional protective measures such as semicircumstance testing and yearly check-up of cigarette leaking during hand placement do not suffice to prevent gastrial contents from asping in this manner. Further studies are needed to determine whether this drug actually prevents ventilator-associated pneumonia, bronchitis or  asthma attacks.</text>
