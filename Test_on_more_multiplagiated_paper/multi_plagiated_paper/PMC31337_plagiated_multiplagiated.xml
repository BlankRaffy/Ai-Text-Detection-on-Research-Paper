    <text>The recognition of RNA-proteins is one of the most well-known by genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches. The primary and secondary structures of operator ARN are illustrated in Figure 1. This enables the formation of contacts with both subunits of coat protein. However, X-ray crystallography fails to identify specific amino acid-nucleotide contacts, leading to non-identical interactions between A-4 and A-10 that play a significant role in regulating repression of DNA.</text>

    <text>Findings indicate that ethylene, which is produced by ethephon, was found to mediate intracellular calcium level ([Ca2+]i) in mouse NIH-3T3 and human HeLa and SaOS-2 cells. These findings provide support for previous findings of increased [Cava2 +]inhibition, as well as an increase in the expression of an enriched form-factor gene, SDERR, in invertebrate cells (primmorphs of the marine sponge S. domuncula).</text>
