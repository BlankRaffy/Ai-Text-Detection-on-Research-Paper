    <text>The expression level of some genes expressed in the postnatal developing brain varies from newborn to adult development, and it is possible that these developmentalally regulated transcripts are molecular markers for the complex developmental process occurring in this area.</text>

    <text>Our approach to producing ECGs has been tested in conscious mice, but existing methods necessitate restraint or anesthesia and surgical implantation of telemetry devices. Anesthesia, on the other hand, can depress cardiovascular function and takes almost 3 weeks for successful recovery. To validate this approach, we developed another method called e-MOUSETM, which is openly accessible to the biotechnology community and involves analyzing data from both gender groups through a web application.</text>

    <text>In summary, we found that cisapride reduces the risk of gastric contents aspiration in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients who are kept in a semirecumbent position. However, our findings suggest that conventional protective measures such as semicircumstance testing and yearly check-up of cigarette leaking during hand placement do not suffice to prevent gastrial contents from asping in this manner. Further studies are needed to determine whether this drug actually prevents ventilator-associated pneumonia, bronchitis or  asthma attacks.</text>
