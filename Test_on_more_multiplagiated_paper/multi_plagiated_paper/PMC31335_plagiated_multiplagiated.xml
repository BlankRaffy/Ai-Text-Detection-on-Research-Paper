    <text>AER, vibrissal placodes, and proliferating stem cell populations that produce multiple differentiated tissues (tail bud mesenchyme, pharyngeal endoderm and meSenchime) are among the sites where Gad1 expression occurs, with changes in GABA signaling activity being observed in these tissues.</text>

    <text>TFIID, a background RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription factor, is composed of the TATA-binding protein and dozens of TBP-associated factors (TAFIIs). There are at least 12 known examples of this factor in human evolution.</text>

    <text>Findings indicate that ethylene, which is produced by ethephon, was found to mediate intracellular calcium level ([Ca2+]i) in mouse NIH-3T3 and human HeLa and SaOS-2 cells. These findings provide support for previous findings of increased [Cava2 +]inhibition, as well as an increase in the expression of an enriched form-factor gene, SDERR, in invertebrate cells (primmorphs of the marine sponge S. domuncula).</text>
