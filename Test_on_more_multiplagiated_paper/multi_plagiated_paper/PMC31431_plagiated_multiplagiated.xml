    <text>Our technology enables non-invasive screening of large numbers of mice for ECG changes caused by genetic, pharmacological, or pathophysiological changes. Not only does this match the data reported so far with expensive and invasive methods, but it also provides new insights into gender- and age-dependent differences in EKGs in mice.</text>

    <text>In pharmacological terms, chemoprevention refers to the use of non-infectious nutrient supplements or other drugs that enhance the physiological mechanisms responsible for protecting against the development of mutant clones leading to malignant cancer. A recent landmark trial demonstrated that tamoxifen, an active hormonally active selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), decreased the risk of advanced breast cancer by 49% in asymptomatic women. As fewer agents were found effective in these trials, efforts are underway to develop useful tissue biomarker</text>

    <text>As with other behaviors, the quinpirole preparation promotes a compulsive checking behavior that can be suspended in the presence of appropriate stimuli. However, when the checking-evoking cues persist, rats will resume their checks again, similar to how OCD patients exhibit failed resistence towards performing their rituals after completing them. These findings are consistent with the belief that taking the pill or something similar can lead to successful treatment.</text>
