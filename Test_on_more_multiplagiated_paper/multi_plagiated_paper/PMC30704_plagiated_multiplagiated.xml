    <text>The absence of mutations in the desmuslin gene did not impact its function. Nevertheless, the single-nucleotide polymorphisms mapped in this study are highly disequilibrated and can be used for disambiguation studies of this region of chromosome 15q26.3.</text>

    <text>In summary, Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that is often accompanied by synovitis of the joints, tendon sheaths, and bursae, but not always with systemic manifestations that do not involve the synospheric synagogue. These manifestation(s) are likely to be mediated by immunologic processes, while those of non-synonymous &quot;cells&quot; such as articular cell proliferation, neopathogen</text>

    <text>In the study of gene expression in the murine brain after birth, we have determined that approximately one-fifth of genes transcribed are highly regulated, allowing those interested in such expression to selectively isolate them rather than undergoing a comprehensive screening process. We have presented three broad categories of transcripts (A and B) in order of significance, with changes in expression profiles reflecting changes during brain development and concluding that these changes reflect variations in overall expression levels.</text>
