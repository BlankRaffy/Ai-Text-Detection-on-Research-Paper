    <text>Pneumocystis carinii is a pathogen that causes pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. The relationship between this organism and the host cell is unclear, with some hypothesizing factors such as laminin or vitronectin upregulating the surface Glycinecine/Phenoic Acid complex found on human skin.</text>

    <text>We have demonstrated that MCM2 antibodies can provide consistent, reliable staining in fixed tissues without the need for antigen retrieval. The results obtained are easy to interpret as there is a significant difference between normal bronchoepithelium and premalignant lesions, making it an easy-to-use marker that has great potential for assessment of the progression and regression of morphologically abnormal lesIONS in future primary lung cancer prevention studies and for early detection of lung Cancer screening studies.</text>
