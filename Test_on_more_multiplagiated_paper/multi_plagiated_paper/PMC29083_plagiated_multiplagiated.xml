    <text>The absence of mutations in the desmuslin gene did not impact its function. Nevertheless, the single-nucleotide polymorphisms mapped in this study are highly disequilibrated and can be used for disambiguation studies of this region of chromosome 15q26.3.</text>

    <text>The process of translation decoding is characterized by translation termination, which is an essential step in the decoder of information. Its accuracy allows for the synthesis of only a few abnormal products under normal conditions. In other words, most animal and plant viruses use translation terminating events as means of controlling expression through recoding events. Readthrough is different from selenocysteine incorporation, with no specific partner being involved. Past studies have shown that efficient termination events are driven by change in these contexts, such as in Sindbis virus or purely genetically</text>

    <text>Using the tree harvest procedure, we will attempt to find additive and interaction structure among clusters of genes that relate to an outcome measure. This method is particularly challenging due to the limited number of available samples for this particular purpose. We will initially use a stepwise strategy using the sum and products of the average gene expression of chosen cluster(s) of trees to learn about gene activity in larger data sets (details here). We believe that models could be constructed from these clustered models, as other methods including tree-based models or boosting techniques.</text>
