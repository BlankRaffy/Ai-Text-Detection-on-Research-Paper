    <text>Despite the fact that shape alone could not differentiate between retraction fibers and advancing, retracting or stable filopodia, the use of fluorescent imaging of C-moesin-GFP paralleled the rapid and dynamic changes of the actin cytoskeleton in microextensions. Regional regulatory control is implicated because opposite changes occur in close proximity to each other. This new and sensitive tool should be useful in investigating mechanisms of localized actIN dynamics in the cell cortex.</text>

    <text>There are three homologous members of the Fragile X Mental Retardation protein family. The Fragument induced supramenopausal (FMRP) is caused by the x-linked FMR1 gene, which has been linked to human hereditary mental retardation. These proteins contain two KH domains and a RGG box, and are associated with nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal(NES) within actively translating ribosomes. However, it is unclear whether these genes can compensate for the absence of FMRP in this condition.</text>

    <text>These studies suggest that PP5 plays a role in controlling nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and that the suppression of pythonic regulatory protein 5 (PP5) leads to nuclear accumulation of highly reactive GRs without the presence of any hormone. This implies that there is likely more nuclear activity associated with the increase in generative gene expression (GR)-induced transcriptional activity after ISIS 15534 induced translation from Greek, suggesting that this may be due to either nuclear upregulation or export of genetically modified genes.</text>
