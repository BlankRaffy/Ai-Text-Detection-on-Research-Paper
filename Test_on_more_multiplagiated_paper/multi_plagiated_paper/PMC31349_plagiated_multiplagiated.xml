    <text>Our investigation reveals that the expression of AQP8 is indicative of normal colonic epithelial cells, which may indicate their involvement in fluid transport within the colon.</text>

    <text>At the secondary lymphoid organs, efficient interactions between T, B and antigen-presenting cells occur. T cells are primarily located in the paracortical zone, which includes interfollicular regions. Small primary fojicles inthe cortex become secondary fungus or germinal centres (GCs) after antigenic stimulation. Technically, the development of the GC reaction is mediated by both cellular contacts and humoral factors such as CD40L (assisted metochortic acid) expressed by T cell also activated B cells that produce memory B</text>

    <text>We have demonstrated that MCM2 antibodies can provide consistent, reliable staining in fixed tissues without the need for antigen retrieval. The results obtained are easy to interpret as there is a significant difference between normal bronchoepithelium and premalignant lesions, making it an easy-to-use marker that has great potential for assessment of the progression and regression of morphologically abnormal lesIONS in future primary lung cancer prevention studies and for early detection of lung Cancer screening studies.</text>
