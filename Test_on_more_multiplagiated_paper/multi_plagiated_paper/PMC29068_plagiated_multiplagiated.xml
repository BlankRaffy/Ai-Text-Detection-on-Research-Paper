    <text>The impact of glucocorticoids on various cellular functions is regulated by their interaction with soluble intracellular receptors. In most cells, unliganded GRs are located in the cytoplasm as a heteromeric complex composed mostly of heat shock proteins (hsp90 and hr70) or other proteins. NLSs act as an intermediate site for repressing the formation of primary response genes by binding to greaves. However, there is limited information available on how this mechanism is controlled.</text>

    <text>The significance of using functional and structural approaches to understand molecular interactions is highlighted by the fact that some contacts in the x-ray structure of the MS2 RNA-protein complex are significantly absent, while others remain significant. Figure 4 illustrates the important interactions at A-4 and A-10, including Val29 and Lys61.</text>
