    <text>According to the current research, certain relevant factors that restrict axonal growth on white matter are not haptotactic and may involve myelin-related &quot;inhibitors&quot;, which could be involved in any way.</text>

    <text>The impact of glucocorticoids on various cellular functions is regulated by their interaction with soluble intracellular receptors. In most cells, unliganded GRs are located in the cytoplasm as a heteromeric complex composed mostly of heat shock proteins (hsp90 and hr70) or other proteins. NLSs act as an intermediate site for repressing the formation of primary response genes by binding to greaves. However, there is limited information available on how this mechanism is controlled.</text>

    <text>The findings suggest that both white matter and peripheral nerves have a unique mechanism for limiting axial movement. This may be due to factors such as mechanical stress, cell death, and the pace of degeneration.</text>
