    <text>The absence of mutations in the desmuslin gene did not impact its function. Nevertheless, the single-nucleotide polymorphisms mapped in this study are highly disequilibrated and can be used for disambiguation studies of this region of chromosome 15q26.3.</text>

    <text>NR6A1, the germ cell nuclear factor, is a superfamily of nuclear receptors. It was originally isolated from mouse cDNA libraries, but homologs have been identified in humans, frogs and fish. As no ligand has been discovered, it is designated an orphan receptor. According to evolutionary studies, only the larger transcript found in somatic cells (and apparently in all other cell types) are highly expressed.</text>

    <text>Findings indicate that ethylene, which is produced by ethephon, was found to mediate intracellular calcium level ([Ca2+]i) in mouse NIH-3T3 and human HeLa and SaOS-2 cells. These findings provide support for previous findings of increased [Cava2 +]inhibition, as well as an increase in the expression of an enriched form-factor gene, SDERR, in invertebrate cells (primmorphs of the marine sponge S. domuncula).</text>
