    <text>These studies suggest that PP5 plays a role in controlling nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and that the suppression of pythonic regulatory protein 5 (PP5) leads to nuclear accumulation of highly reactive GRs without the presence of any hormone. This implies that there is likely more nuclear activity associated with the increase in generative gene expression (GR)-induced transcriptional activity after ISIS 15534 induced translation from Greek, suggesting that this may be due to either nuclear upregulation or export of genetically modified genes.</text>
