    <text>The impact of glucocorticoids on various cellular functions is regulated by their interaction with soluble intracellular receptors. In most cells, unliganded GRs are located in the cytoplasm as a heteromeric complex composed mostly of heat shock proteins (hsp90 and hr70) or other proteins. NLSs act as an intermediate site for repressing the formation of primary response genes by binding to greaves. However, there is limited information available on how this mechanism is controlled.</text>

    <text>In summary, this research reveals that -dystroglycan is not found at high concentrations in central neurons of the forebrain region, but appears to be concentrated at the interface between endothelial cells and glia. These structures may represent endfeet on astrocytes at least at half the blood-brainer level. However, in dystrophic for–µbraIN, it appears that up-regulation of utrophin isoforms moderately affects its expression. Dp71 does not necessarily mean abnormal</text>
