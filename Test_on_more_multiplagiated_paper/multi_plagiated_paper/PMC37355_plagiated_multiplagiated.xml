    <text>The functional hOR repertoire's identification and cloning provide a framework for addressing many unresolved issues in human olfactory responses. This will be possible by utilizing robust heterologous expression and assay systems, as well as high-throughput screening of odorant libraries, to gain insight into structure-function relationships and small-molecule recognition by this large group of G-protein-coupled receptors. Another exciting area of interest is the impact of genetic polymorphism of ORs on differential omeg</text>
