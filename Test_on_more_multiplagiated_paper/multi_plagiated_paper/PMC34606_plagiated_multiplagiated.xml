    <text>Xanthurenic acid is produced upon the degradation of tryptophan by indoleamine-2,3 dioxygenase (IDO), and its products include nicotinate and xanthenic acids. Superoxide radicals, liposaccharides, and interferon- promote the activity of IDO, while cytochrome A1b or KAT inhibits it.</text>
