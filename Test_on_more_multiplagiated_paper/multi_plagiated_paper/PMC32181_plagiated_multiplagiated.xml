    <text>By examining the effects of hyperosmotic stress and intracellular acidification on endocytosis, we propose that both hypoxia by high pH and reduced cellular activity are mediated by pleiotropic effects.</text>

    <text>We have recently identified ethylene as a key regulator of plant growth, development and senescence. It is also involved in various stress responses such as activation of the calcium/protein phosphate receptor (PAP) and modulation or even death of cells caused by starvation.</text>

    <text>Lastly, we demonstrate with various antibodies that both broad-spectrum BRCA1 and BRAC2 proteins are widely expressed in two types of non-embryogenic human tissues associated with the cell cycle: Brahmi1, Brca1 (B.rogena) and Brrgium2. Britain1 is expressed during growth and differentiation in the ovary, while Braz2 is present outside the site of spermatogenesis.</text>
