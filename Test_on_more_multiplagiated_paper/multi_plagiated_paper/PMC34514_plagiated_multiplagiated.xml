    <text>Our research indicates that the vitamin D receptor initiation codon polymorphism is a factor in the genetic susceptibility of Japanese T1DM. This polypheny is also associated with GAD65-Ab-positive T1.</text>

    <text>This document describes the supervised learning approach we will use to learn about gene expression data using &quot;tree harvesting.&quot; We have real-valued expression measurements for thousands of genes, but with an expected &quot;outcome&quot; in future, we need to consider all available features and methods for predicting outcomes. If these methods are not feasible, they will be called 'classification' or linear regression. The problem is that the number of inputs (genes) is very large compared to the quantity of samples, and hence our prediction model is more flexible.</text>

    <text>We have developed an algorithm for mapping the positively selected mutations of viral quasispecies using sequence data. This method was used to map the positive selected variants (for example, those of influenza A HA, HIV-1 RT and HIV-120), as well as other obvious examples of selective mapping targeting viral subpopulations under different selective pressures: For example we used selection mapping of HIV isolates with different cellular tropisms; another application of this principle is possible for HIV breakthrough infections where we determined whether vaccines prevented the HIV quasivalent vaccine substances from a greater distance</text>
