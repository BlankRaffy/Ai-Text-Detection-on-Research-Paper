    <text>It seemed that the mec-3 upstream sequence was titrating a DNA-binding factor that is essential for the proper movement of ALMs. As this factor could potentially change the direction of these migrations, it may be included in arbitrary software that specifies the fate of touch receptor neurons.</text>

    <text>The role of dystrophin and its associated proteins in the anchoring of the muscle cell membrane to the extracellular matrix is known from the phylogenetic analysis of muscular dystrophy, with the absence of these proteins leading to this phenotype.</text>

    <text>Findings indicate that ethylene, which is produced by ethephon, was found to mediate intracellular calcium level ([Ca2+]i) in mouse NIH-3T3 and human HeLa and SaOS-2 cells. These findings provide support for previous findings of increased [Cava2 +]inhibition, as well as an increase in the expression of an enriched form-factor gene, SDERR, in invertebrate cells (primmorphs of the marine sponge S. domuncula).</text>
