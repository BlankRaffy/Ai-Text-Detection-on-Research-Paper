    <text>During myogenesis, FXR1P isoforms exhibit a distinct pattern of subcellular partitioning that differs from other families of FMR proteins. As the role of this protein in Fragile X syndrome is still unknown, the model system described here should be viewed as primarily focusing on building models to understand the structure-function relationships among various members of the FARM family.</text>

    <text>The role of dystrophin and its associated proteins in the anchoring of the muscle cell membrane to the extracellular matrix is known from the phylogenetic analysis of muscular dystrophy, with the absence of these proteins leading to this phenotype.</text>

    <text>In the study of gene expression in the murine brain after birth, we have determined that approximately one-fifth of genes transcribed are highly regulated, allowing those interested in such expression to selectively isolate them rather than undergoing a comprehensive screening process. We have presented three broad categories of transcripts (A and B) in order of significance, with changes in expression profiles reflecting changes during brain development and concluding that these changes reflect variations in overall expression levels.</text>
