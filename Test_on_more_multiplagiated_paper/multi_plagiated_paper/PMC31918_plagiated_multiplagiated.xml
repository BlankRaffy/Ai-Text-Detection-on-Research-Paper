    <text>Bacillus anthracis and Yersinia pestis are classified as having an average density of tandem repeat arrays over 100 bp in comparison to other bacterial genomes studied so far, and testing a fraction of these sequences for polymorphism yielded dozens of informative markers, some of which displayed remarkably high levels of polychromatisim, including allele length from 600-1950 bps and nine all√®les resolved in the small number of independent Bacilles strains typed here.</text>

    <text>Over the last five years, the genomes of four distinct eukaryotic organisms have been fully sequenced. This includes Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a unicellular EC2, two multicellular organismS, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsisthaliana. The analysis of these major groups of organismses allows for comparative analysis (deduction) of genes and gene families across phylogenetically diverse organism species.</text>

    <text>The use of mRNA differential display was employed to identify genes that have been altered in Pneumocystis carinii-infected hosts. The nucleotide sequence of one of the fragments displayed in the differentially determined expression corresponded to the gene encoding the rat mitochondrial ATPase 6, which is a subunit of F0F1-ATP synthases.
