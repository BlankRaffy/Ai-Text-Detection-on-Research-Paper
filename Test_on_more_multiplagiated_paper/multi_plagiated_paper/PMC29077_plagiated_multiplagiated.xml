    <text>The CMV IE1 promoter/enhancer is not restricted to specific types of fibers, but it can still drive germ-line transgene expression. This is important because not all fiber varieties express the same gene at high levels due to regional differences in overall expression levels and within-fiber-type variability. Given the multinucleate syncitial nature of muscle fiberd regions, it is unlikely that this variability is caused by variegating heterochromatinization. The soleus muscle, however, would be suitable for experimental gene driven by CNVX1 elements.</text>

    <text>Hypothetical models suggest that deficiency in the cytoskeletal component of dystrophin may lead to muscular dystrophy due to its lack of it, which results in impaired sarcolemmal integrity and the disruption or non-existent clustering of ion channel complexes.</text>

    <text>Research on the characterization of protein complexes in skeletal muscle and heart, including information regarding genotype-phenotype relationships, will contribute to understanding the pathophysiology of human muscle diseases. We encourage other groups to test for the C598T DMN mutation in their human patient samples affected by muscular and cardiac diseases as well as generate desmuslin null animal models to further understand this important protein.</text>
