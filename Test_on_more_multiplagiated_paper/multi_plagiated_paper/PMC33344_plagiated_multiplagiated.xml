    <text>Fluorescent labeling of SP has been shown to have altered both the biological activity and binding properties of the parent peptide. The most effective fluorophores for this purpose are Oregon Green 488 and BODIPY FL-SP, which can be used to identify other ways to label SP without affecting its biological function. These findings suggest that additional research should be conducted to understand the mechanisms of SPR function, such as receptor localization, internalization or recycling.</text>

    <text>We have recently identified ethylene as a key regulator of plant growth, development and senescence. It is also involved in various stress responses such as activation of the calcium/protein phosphate receptor (PAP) and modulation or even death of cells caused by starvation.</text>

    <text>In summary, we found that cisapride reduces the risk of gastric contents aspiration in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients who are kept in a semirecumbent position. However, our findings suggest that conventional protective measures such as semicircumstance testing and yearly check-up of cigarette leaking during hand placement do not suffice to prevent gastrial contents from asping in this manner. Further studies are needed to determine whether this drug actually prevents ventilator-associated pneumonia, bronchitis or  asthma attacks.</text>
