    <infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon>
    <text>In this study, we use a new statistical method called gene shaving to identify groups of elements (genes) that exhibit coherent expression and are optimal for different properties of the variation in their expression.</text>

    <text>This exploratory study demonstrates &quot;...any association between the polymorphisms in codon 27 of ADRB2 and in [ADRB3] genes that may be associated with increased risk of breast cancer&quot;; however, additional studies across larger samples and/or across different ethnicities are needed to further explore this effect.</text>
