    <text>By means of sequence profile searches, we reveal that 2OG-Fe(II) oxygenase fold is present in multiple protein families that were previously unknown to us, enabling us to predict the catalytic activity of various biologically relevant proteins from eukaryotes and bacteria.</text>

    <text>Findings indicate that ethylene, which is produced by ethephon, was found to mediate intracellular calcium level ([Ca2+]i) in mouse NIH-3T3 and human HeLa and SaOS-2 cells. These findings provide support for previous findings of increased [Cava2 +]inhibition, as well as an increase in the expression of an enriched form-factor gene, SDERR, in invertebrate cells (primmorphs of the marine sponge S. domuncula).</text>
