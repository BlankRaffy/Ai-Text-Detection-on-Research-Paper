    <text>The aim of this study was to determine the extent of B-cell clonal diversity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, using HCDR3 as a marker. They also used PCR techniques to identify and differentiate between numerically expanded and un-expanded B cells using genomic DNA or complementary (c)DNA from peripheral blood and synovial fluid, which allowed for the identification of various autoimmune reaction vectors. These results support the idea that cellular genetic information may be relevant in understanding the causes of immune responses in inflammatory markers like reder</text>

    <text>Research on the characterization of protein complexes in skeletal muscle and heart, including information regarding genotype-phenotype relationships, will contribute to understanding the pathophysiology of human muscle diseases. We encourage other groups to test for the C598T DMN mutation in their human patient samples affected by muscular and cardiac diseases as well as generate desmuslin null animal models to further understand this important protein.</text>
