    <text>The results suggest that normal F9 cell differentiation requires the appropriately timed proteolysis of TBP and TAFII135, which is necessary for the regulation of genes by transactivators and other basal transcription factors.</text>

    <text>Astrocytes are the dominant type of cell in central nervous system and play a significant role in modulating neuronal activity. They have also been shown to be involved in several physiopathological brain events, including the synthesis and secretion of neurotrophic growth factors. However, there is no consensus on whether these connections, which involve specific intercellular connections or selective release of chemical signals from mammalian astrocytes, are solely responsible for modulation of intracellular Ca2+ waves.</text>

    <text>In summary, we found that cisapride reduces the risk of gastric contents aspiration in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients who are kept in a semirecumbent position. However, our findings suggest that conventional protective measures such as semicircumstance testing and yearly check-up of cigarette leaking during hand placement do not suffice to prevent gastrial contents from asping in this manner. Further studies are needed to determine whether this drug actually prevents ventilator-associated pneumonia, bronchitis or  asthma attacks.</text>
