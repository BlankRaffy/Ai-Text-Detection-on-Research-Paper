    <text>We used a carcinogenic rat model of mammary tumorigenesis to test the hypothesis that transforming growth factor (TGF)-s are useful biomarkers for chemotherapy prevention in the breast. The chemopreventive agents tested were tamoxifen and retinoids (9cRA) and N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retiNamide (4-HPR), as none of these agents, alone or in combination, had demonstrably increased TGF-I expression in this model but still showed no clinical indication.</text>

    <text>In this report, we describe how we have found RAR agonists with unique structural properties, thanks to the rapid discovery of new ones using a powerful virtual-ligand screening approach and avoiding the use of existing research strategies. The study presents one of the molecules as an example of these new pathways that could provide more favorable structural characteristics and potentially become valuable in cancer therapy.</text>
