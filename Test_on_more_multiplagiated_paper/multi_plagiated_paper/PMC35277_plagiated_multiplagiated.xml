    <text>For this reason, the helicase activity and the C-terminal domain of BLM are important factors for maintaining genomic stability as measured by the sister chromatid exchange assay, and it seems that the amount of Câ€“terminally abundant (GLD) localization of these molecules into the nucleolus by mutually agreed upon Cterminality appears to be more important for genomic instability than localized localisation in the nuclear bodies.</text>

    <text>NR6A1, the germ cell nuclear factor, is a superfamily of nuclear receptors. It was originally isolated from mouse cDNA libraries, but homologs have been identified in humans, frogs and fish. As no ligand has been discovered, it is designated an orphan receptor. According to evolutionary studies, only the larger transcript found in somatic cells (and apparently in all other cell types) are highly expressed.</text>

    <text>According to the current data, clonal expansion is a prevalent feature of the B-cell repertoire in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This process involves both resting memory B cells and activated B cell populations, which can be derived from within the bloodstream or synovial compartments, and may involve localized antigens located in the synoptics of joints.</text>
