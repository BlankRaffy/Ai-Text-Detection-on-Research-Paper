    <text>Our study demonstrates that survivin may play a crucial role in the survival of embryonic SMG epithelial cells, as it is known to promote survival through its pro-survival and anti-apoptotic properties. Furthermore, survisin protein localization into the nucleus is essential for cell cycle entry and preventing cellular death.</text>

    <text>Astrocytes are the dominant type of cell in central nervous system and play a significant role in modulating neuronal activity. They have also been shown to be involved in several physiopathological brain events, including the synthesis and secretion of neurotrophic growth factors. However, there is no consensus on whether these connections, which involve specific intercellular connections or selective release of chemical signals from mammalian astrocytes, are solely responsible for modulation of intracellular Ca2+ waves.</text>

    <text>We have demonstrated that MCM2 antibodies can provide consistent, reliable staining in fixed tissues without the need for antigen retrieval. The results obtained are easy to interpret as there is a significant difference between normal bronchoepithelium and premalignant lesions, making it an easy-to-use marker that has great potential for assessment of the progression and regression of morphologically abnormal lesIONS in future primary lung cancer prevention studies and for early detection of lung Cancer screening studies.</text>
