    <text>Early peri-operative hyperglycaemia and renal allograft rejection in patients without diabetes</text>

    <infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon>
    <text>The association between hyperglycaemia and an increased risk of allograft rejection is consistent with findings in patients with diabetes. We propose a causal link that is congruent with both epidemiological and in vitro studies and suggest that additional clinical research is necessary.</text>

    <text>There are three homologous members of the Fragile X Mental Retardation protein family. The Fragument induced supramenopausal (FMRP) is caused by the x-linked FMR1 gene, which has been linked to human hereditary mental retardation. These proteins contain two KH domains and a RGG box, and are associated with nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal(NES) within actively translating ribosomes. However, it is unclear whether these genes can compensate for the absence of FMRP in this condition.</text>

    <text>This exploratory study demonstrates &quot;...any association between the polymorphisms in codon 27 of ADRB2 and in [ADRB3] genes that may be associated with increased risk of breast cancer&quot;; however, additional studies across larger samples and/or across different ethnicities are needed to further explore this effect.</text>
